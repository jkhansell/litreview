Our approach adapts the flux vector splitting method proposed by Toro and Vázquez-Cendón (2012) and separates the system into two subsystems: a conservative advection system and a non-conservative pressure system, both characterized by simpler eigenstructures compared to the full system. The numerical scheme combines a Godunov-type path-conservative method for the pressure system with a conservative Godunov method for the advection system, solved using a coupled solution strategy. To achieve second-order accuracy in space and time, the first-order method is enhanced via the ADER approach and an AENO reconstruction technique. The scheme's accuracy, robustness, and well-balanced properties are evaluated using a carefully chosen set of test cases, demonstrating its simplicity and effectiveness, comparable to advanced Godunov methods. A key feature of the proposed scheme is its flexibility in selecting sediment transport closure formulas, making it highly suitable for scientific and engineering applications.","2022-01","2024-09-25 15:14:12","2024-12-01 00:43:24","","104062","","","159","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: Elsevier BV","","C:\Users\johan\Zotero\storage\Y8XKV7FW\Siviglia et al. - 2022 - A splitting scheme for the coupled Saint-Venant-Exner model.pdf","","Sediment transport; Numerical morphodynamics; ADER Method; Finite volume methods; Flux splitting; Saint-Venant-Exner model","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Nevertheless, other possible applications exist. In particular, bed-load transport phenomena are relevant in urban drainage systems, including sewers. However, few applications of coupled two-dimensional (2D) shallow-water and bed-load transport models can be found, and their transfer from environmental applications?usually river and floodplain?into sewer applications requires some adaptation. Unlike to river systems, where there is a thick layer of sediment that constitutes a movable riverbed, sewer systems have thin layers of sediment that need to be removed, thus exposing a rigid, nonerodible surface. This problem requires careful numerical treatment to avoid generating errors and instability in the simulation. This paper deals with a numerical approach to tackle this issue in an efficient way that allows large-scale studies to be performed and provides empirical evidence that the proposed approach is accurate and applicable for sewage and channel-flushing problems.","2017","2024-09-25 15:14:13","2024-12-01 00:02:33","","","","9","143","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","_eprint: http://ascelibrary.org/doi/pdf/10.1061/%28ASCE%29HY.1943-7900.0001337","","C:\Users\johan\Zotero\storage\GPYCYZYL\Caviedes-Voullième et al. - 2017 - Two-Dimensional Numerical Simulation of Bed-Load Transport of a Finite-Depth Sediment Layer Applica.pdf","","Exner equation; Shallow water; Channel flushing; Finite-depth sediment layer; Graphics-processing unit (GPU) computing; Maximum erodability; Partially erodible bed; Thin sediment layer","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The Exner equation is used to model the morphological evolution of the bed, while a closure equation is needed to evaluate the rate of sediment transport. The system of Saint-Venant-Exner equations is solved in a fully coupled way using a finite-volume technique and a HLLC solver for the fluxes, with a novel wave-speed estimator adapted to the Exner equation. Wave speeds are usually derived by computing the eigenvalues of the full system, which is highly time-consuming when no analytical expression is available. In this paper, an eigenvalue analysis of the full system is conducted, leading to simple but still accurate wave-speed estimators. The new numerical scheme is then tested in three different situations: (1) a circular dam-break flow over movable bed, (2) an one-dimensional bed aggradation problem simulated on a 2D unstructured mesh and (3) the case of a dam-break flow in an erodible channel with a sudden enlargement, for which experimental measurements are available.

The flow hydrodynamics is represented by the shallow water equations, and the bed morphodynamics is represented by the Exner equation and an additional equation describing the nonequilibrium sediment transport. Sediment size distribution is represented by the median grain diameter and the standard deviation, instead of the usual modeling with multiple particle size classes. Various methods for computing bed elevation changes at a cross section due to erosion or deposition of sediment are proposed and tested, including an innovative approach that relates the spatial pattern of erosion and deposition rates to boundary shear stress distribution, which is calculated by the Merged Perpendicular Method. An explicit finite difference scheme is employed for solving the water and sediment governing equations. The pertinence of the model is examined for two hypothetical cases. The model is then tested on one set of laboratory experiments on bed degradation under steady flow, showing excellent model data fit, and indicating that incorporating a nonequilibrium sediment transport equation into the model structure is an important element in reproducing the bed degradation process. Finally, the model is applied to simulate the morphological changes taking place in the Ha! Ha! River (Quebec) after the failure of the Ha! Ha! Dyke on July 1996. Relevant results can be obtained in terms of changes in longitudinal bed profile and cross-sectional geometry as well as water levels, although some discrepancies are obtained between the simulated and surveyed cross-sectional geometries, mainly because bank failure and channel widening are not modeled.","2009-05-07","2024-11-20 00:35:49","2024-12-01 00:02:27","","","","","45","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: 2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA Publisher: AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION Type: Article","","C:\Users\johan\Zotero\storage\TRMUSQZB\Abderrezzak and Paquier - 2009 - One-dimensional numerical modeling of sediment transport and bed deformation in open channels.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The solution strategy relies on a full coupling of the governing equations within each time step. The resulting system of governing equations contains nonconservative products related to the longitudinal and lateral bed slopes and source terms related to friction. The full problem is solved numerically on unstructured triangular grids, simultaneously updating the principal part and adding the source terms (friction) using a splitting technique. The principal part is solved by means of a novel second-order accurate upwind-biased centred scheme of the finite volume type, while the source terms are added to the problem by solving a system of ordinary differential equations. A new algorithm for treating the wetting-and-drying is also proposed. The model is applied to well-established test problems in order to verify the accuracy of the proposed method, the robustness of the wetting-and-drying algorithm and the ability of the model in dealing with transcritical flows. Finally we test the model ability to reproduce two dimensional morphodynamic processes occurring at the scale of tens of channel widths in bedload dominated alluvial rivers with homogeneous grain size. This is achieved by comparing model outcomes with those of analytical theories and flume experiments on the same morphodynamic processes. These selected “benchmarks” include migrating free bars spontaneously developing in straight reaches, steady bars forced by abrupt river planform changes and the dynamics of channel bifurcations.

The model includes a robust hydrodynamic solver for the integration of the nonlinear shallow water equations (NSWE) and a rather flexible solver for the resolution of the Exner equation (used to evaluate the morphological evolution of the seabed). A detailed analysis is given of existing and novel procedures for the solution of the morphodynamic problem. Coupling of NSWE and Exner equations and updating of the solution is made by means of a sequential splitting scheme. The model has been validated by reproducing both analytical and numerical solutions, available in the recent literature, as well as an in-house laboratory experiment. The simulation of existing theoretical solutions has revealed the model performs well, especially in the prediction of the seabed evolution due to either bed-load or suspended-load transport forced by dam-break and swash-type events. The latter ones are seen to force both erosion and accretion despite the weak hydro-morphodynamic coupling. The comparison between solver results and experimental data is also encouraging, the solver reproducing well the main seabed features forced by irregular waves. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

First we show that the Saint-Venant-Exner equations are linearly unstable in most cases for a uniform base flow down an inclined erodible bed for Shields numbers in excess of the threshold for incipient sediment motion allowing us to compute noise-induced pattern formation for Froude numbers below 2. The wavelength of the bed forms are selected naturally due to the absolute character of the bed instability and the existence of a maximum growth rate at a finite wavelength when the particle diffusivity coefficient and the water eddy viscosity are present as for Turing-like instability. A num e rical method is subsequently developed to analyze the performance of the model and theoretical results through three examples: the simulation of the fluctuations of the particle concentration using a stochastic Langevin equation, the deterministic simulation of anti-dunes formation over an erodible slope in full sediment-mobility conditions, and the computation of noise-induced pattern formation in hybrid stochasticdeterministic flows down a periodic flume. The full non-linear numerical simulations are in excellent agreement with the theoretical solutions. We conclude highlighting that the proposed depth-averaged formulation explains the developments of upstream migrating anti-dunes in straight flumes since the seminar experiments by Gilbert (1914).

In particular, the dam-break/bore-collapse initial condition of Shen & Meyer (J. Fluid Mech., vol. 16, 1963, pp. 113-125) and Peregrine & Williams (J. Fluid Mech., vol. 440, 2001, pp. 391-399) is investigated using a numerical model based on the method of characteristics. A sediment-transport formula (cubic in velocity u: Au-3) is used here; this belongs to a family of sediment-transport formulae for which Pritchard & Hogg (Coastal Engng, vol. 52, 2005, pp. 1-23) showed that net sediment transport under the Shen & Meyer (1963) bore collapse is offshore throughout the swash zone when a non-erodible bed is considered. It is found that full coupling with the beach, although still resulting in the net offshore transport of sediment throughout the swash zone, leads to a large reduction in the net offshore transport of sediment from the beach face. This is particularly true for the upper third of the swash zone. Moreover, in contradistinction to swash flows over non-erodible beds, flows over erodible beaches are unique to the bed mobility and porosity under consideration; this has very important implications for run-up predictions. The conclusion is that it is essential to consider full coupling of water and bed motions (i.e. full morphodynamics) in order to understand and predict sediment transport in the swash, regardless of other physical effects (e.g. turbulence, infiltration, pre-suspended sediment, etc.).","2010-10-25","2024-11-20 00:35:49","2024-12-01 00:02:06","","316-340","","","661","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: 32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA Publisher: CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS Type: Article","","C:\Users\johan\Zotero\storage\P9GCXTKN\Kelly and Dodd - 2010 - Beach-face evolution in the swash zone.pdf","","sediment transport; coastal engineering; shallow-water flows","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Regarding the speed of the computation, the Exner equation slows down the already costly 2D shallow water model as the number of variables to solve is increased and the numerical stability is more restrictive. In order to reduce the computational effort required for simulating realistic scenarios, the authors have exploited the use of Graphics Processing Units in combination with non-trivial optimization procedures.

A system comprising shallow water equations and Exner equation is solved, in which sediment transport rate q is either dependent only on depth averaged velocity (u), or on u and water depth (12). The results are in agreement with equivalent uncoupled results [2] in that all sediment transport formulae considered applied to the event of [1] yield net erosion in the whole of the swash. Consistent with [3], however, full coupling yields significantly less erosion for all the q = q(u) formulae compared to the equivalent uncoupled results. It is shown that differences between uncoupled and coupled approaches (for most formulae) accumulate over the course of the swash event. The main reason for the reduced net erosion is the smaller maximum inundation. It is also shown that including a dependence on h in the bed load sediment transport formula for fully coupled simulations can result in net deposition in the upper swash. Bed shear stress described by a Chezy law is further included in fully coupled simulations to examine net beach change. Much reduced maximum inundation and net offshore sediment transport are predicted both for q = q(u) and q = q(h,u). It is shown that although the net sediment flux at the base of the swash under one [1] swash event is still offshore, deposition in the middle or upper swash may be predicted when bed shear stress is included, particularly when the drag coefficient in the backwash is reduced compared to that in the uprush, consistent with some in-situ measurements. The implication is that bed shear stress must be included not just to obtain correct quantitative beach change, but also to obtain correct qualitative beach behaviour. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

By assuming that the local depth is much smaller than the length of the incoming wave, the shallow water equations are used to determine the water motion. The surf zone width is assumed to be small compared to the length of the incoming wave and hence the effect of wave breaking is included only parametrically. The time development of the cohesionless bottom is described by the Exner continuity equation and by an empirical sediment transport rate formula which relates the sediment flux to the steady currents and wave stirring. It is shown that the basic-state solution, which does not depend on the longshore coordinate, may be unstable with respect to longshore bedform perturbations, so that rhythmic topographies form. The instability process is due to a positive feedback mechanism involving the incoming wave, synchronous edge waves and the bedforms. The growth of the bottom perturbations is related to the presence of steady currents caused by the interaction of the incoming wave with synchronous edge waves which in turn are excited by the incoming wave moving over the wavy bed. For natural beaches the model predicts two maxima in the amplification rate: one is related to incoming waves of low frequency, the other to wind waves.

However, the impact of this technique on the hydraulics conditions, and resulting bed morphology, is yet to be understood. Several numerical tools have been developed during last years for modeling sediment transport and morphology evolution which can be used for this application. These models range from 1D to 3D approaches: the first being over simplistic for the simulation of such a complex geometry; the latter requires often a prohibitive computational effort. However, 2D models are computationally efficient and in these cases may already provide sufficiently accurate predictions of the morphology evolution caused by the sediment replenishment in a river. Here, the 2D shallow water equations in combination with the Exner equation are solved by means of a weak-coupled strategy. The classical friction approach considered for reproducing the bed channel roughness has been modified to take into account the morphological effect of replenishment which provokes a channel bed fining. Computational outcomes are compared with four sets of experimental data obtained from several replenishment configurations studied in the laboratory. The experiments differ in terms of placement volume and configuration. A set of analysis parameters is proposed for the experimental-numerical comparison, with particular attention to the spreading, covered surface and travel distance of placed replenishment grains. The numerical tool is reliable in reproducing the overall tendency shown by the experimental data. The effect of fining roughness is better reproduced with the approach herein proposed. However, it is also highlighted that the sediment clusters found in the experiment are not well numerically reproduced in the regions of the channel with a limited number of sediment grains.

In this paper, these equations are combined with the two-dimensional shallow water equations to describe the flow field. The resulting system of equations can be solved in two ways: (i) in a coupled way, solving flow and sediment equations simultaneously at a given time-step or (ii) in an uncoupled manner by first solving the flow field and using the magnitudes obtained at each time-step to update the channel morphology (bed and surface composition). The coupled strategy is preferable when dealing with strong and quick interactions between the flow field, the bed evolution and the different particle sizes present on the bed surface. A number of numerical difficulties at from solving the fully coupled system of equations. These problems are reduced by means of a weakly-coupled strategy to numerically estimate the wave celerities containing the information of the bed and the grain sizes present on the bed. Hence, a two-dimensional numerical scheme able to simulate in a self-stable way the unsteady morphological evolution of channels formed by cohesionless grain size mixtures is presented. The coupling technique is simplified without decreasing the number of waves involved in the numerical scheme but by simplifying their definitions. The numerical results are satisfactorily tested with synthetic cases and against experimental data. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The method is based on the floating grid-of-characteristics approach, which here is amended to take account of the more complex structure of the field of characteristics inherent in the morphodynamics (compared to those for hydro- or gas dynamics). Due to the relative simplicity of the algorithm the technique is particularly well suited to waves moving into a downstream reach that is initially dry. As with all MOC schemes the approach is also attractive because it reveals the underlying (morpho)dynamics as the solution progresses. The mathematical model considered here is based on the depth averaged non-linear shallow water equations directly coupled to a bed update (Exner) equation. Closure is obtained using a simple sediment flux relation. The technique described allows the study of fully coupled sediment transport problems and the associated hydro- and morphodynamic evolution. Numerical results are presented for the evolution of a sand dune in a tidal flow as well as the wet-dry dam-break problem on both a fixed and mobile bed. Results compare extremely well with the analytical or quasi-analytical solutions for the problems presented. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Moreover, these models are usually not well-balanced, meaning they are unable to correctly simulate quiescent flow. Here a well-balanced and flexible morphological model for the swash zone is presented. The nonlinear shallow water equations and the Exner equation are discretized by the shock-capturing finite volume method, in which the numerical flux and the bed slope source term are estimated by a well-balanced version of the SLIC (slope limited centered) scheme that does not depend on empirical sediment transport relations. The satisfaction of the well-balanced property is demonstrated through simulating quiescent coastal flow. The quantitative accuracy of the model in reproducing key parameters (i.e., the notional shoreline position, the swash depth, the flow velocity, the overtopping flow volume, the beach change depth and the sediment transport rate) is shown to be satisfactory through comparisons against analytical solutions, experimental data as well as previous numerical solutions.

However, the resolution of the sediment continuity equation to simulate bed evolution is a complex problem which often leads to the development of numerical oscillations. To overcome this problem, addition of artificial diffusion or bathymetric filters are commonly employed methods, although these techniques can potentially over-smooth the bathymetry. This study aims to present a numerical scheme based on the Weighted Essentially Non-Oscillatory (WENO) formalism to solve the bed continuity equation on unstructured grids in a finite volume formulation. The new solution is compared against a classical method, which combines a basic node-centered finite volume method with artificial diffusion, for three idealized test cases. This comparison reveals that a higher accuracy is obtained with our new method while the addition of diffusion appears inappropriate mainly due to the arbitrary choice of the diffusion coefficient. Moreover, the increased computation time associated with the WENO-based method to solve the bed continuity equation is negligible when considering a fully-coupled simulation with tides and waves. Finally, the application of the new method to the pluri-monthly evolution of an idealized inlet subjected to tides and waves shows the development of realistic bed features (e.g. secondary flood channels, ebb-delta sandbars, or oblique sandbars at the adjacent beaches), that are smoothed or nonexistent when using additional diffusion.

The DOT path-conservative scheme is a robust upwind method based on a complete Riemann solver, but it has the drawback of requiring expensive numerical computations. Indeed, to compute the non-linear time evolution in each time step, the DOT scheme requires numerical computation of the flux matrix eigenstructure (the totality of eigenvalues and eigenvectors) several times at each cell edge. In this work, an analytical and compact formulation of the eigenstructure for the de Saint Venant-Exner (dSVE) model is introduced and tested in terms of numerical efficiency and stability. Using the original DOT and PRICE-C (a very efficient FORCE-type method) as reference methods, we present a convergence analysis (error against CPU time) to study the performance of the DOT method with our new analytical implementation of eigenstructure calculations (A-DOT). In particular, the numerical performance of the three methods is tested in three test cases: a movable bed Riemann problem with analytical solution; a problem with smooth analytical solution; a test in which the water flow is characterised by subcritical and supercritical regions. For a given target error, the A-DOT method is always the most efficient choice. Finally, two experimental data sets and different transport formulae are considered to test the A-DOT model in more practical case studies.","2018-03","2024-11-20 00:35:50","2024-12-01 00:02:08","","189-201","","","113","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND Publisher: ELSEVIER SCI LTD Type: Article","","C:\Users\johan\Zotero\storage\8HHJENYD\Carraro et al. - 2018 - Efficient analytical implementation of the DOT Riemann solver for the de Saint Venant-Exner morphody.pdf","","DOT Riemann solver; Non-conservative system; Path-conservative scheme; PRICE-C - FORCE; SWE - Exner","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A well-balanced discretization is used for the treatment of source terms. In this paper, we also employ an adaptive procedure in the finite-volume method by monitoring the concentration of suspended sediments in the computational domain during its transport process. The method uses unstructured meshes and incorporates upwinded numerical fluxes and slope limiters to provide sharp resolution of steep sediment concentrations and bed load gradients that may form in the approximate solutions. Details are given on the implementation of the method, and numerical results are presented for two idealized test cases, which demonstrate the accuracy and robustness of the method and its applicability in predicting dam-break flows over erodible sediment beds. The method is also applied to a sediment transport problem in the Nador lagoon. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","2013","2024-11-21 21:06:47","2024-12-01 00:35:47","","967 – 993","","9","72","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Type: Article","","C:\Users\johan\Zotero\storage\6THLSF7D\Benkhaldoun et al. - 2013 - An unstructured finite-volume method for coupled models of suspended sediment and bed load transport.pdf","","Finite volume method; Sediment transport; Suspended sediments; SWE-Exner; finite-volume method; Bed-load transport; Shallow water equations; Unstructured grid; bed load transport; mesh adaptation; Nador lagoon; shallow-water equations; suspended sediment; unstructured grids; 2D; Numerical Method; FVM; Equations of motion; Hydraulics; Flow of water; Jacobian matrices; Numerical methods; Sedimentology; Lakes; Mesh adaptation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this work, the numerical resolution has been implemented using improved and efficient versions of two different strategies for combining the hydrodynamical and morphodynamical components of the system. The first strategy is based on the full coupling of the flow and bedload transport equations (FCM), leading to a new formulation for the intercell numerical fluxes which includes the bed elevation into the resolution of the approximated local Riemann problem (RP) at the edges. The stability region of this method is controlled by the eigenvalues of the coupled Jacobian matrix at each intercell edge. On the second hand, an alternative decoupled strategy is considered based on solving independently the shallow water and the bed transport equations at each time step but controlling the stability region by means of an approximation of the coupled Jacobian matrix eigenvalues. This method, called approximate-coupled (ACM) allows simpler expressions for the numerical fluxes at the edges and ensures the stability of the scheme. Both strategies are based on the Finite Volume (FV) method using Roe's approach for the computation of the numerical fluxes between neighbouring cells and have been implemented into the same CPU-based numerical kernel in order to perform a realistic comparison of the range of applicability and computational efficiency. The ACM can only guarantee non-oscillatory results when the bed-flow interaction factor is small G≤O(10−3). If the interaction factor G is medium or high, G>O(10−2), the decoupled scheme loses its accuracy and robustness. Furthermore, for highly erosive flows the FCM scheme demonstrates to be more efficient in terms of computational effort than the ACM, one of the key points for large-scale and long-term bedload transport realistic applications. © 2021 The Author(s)","2021","2024-11-21 21:06:48","2024-12-01 00:02:07","","","","","153","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Publisher: Elsevier Ltd Type: Article","","C:\Users\johan\Zotero\storage\HH5F3YNA\Martínez-Aranda et al. - 2021 - Comparison of new efficient 2D models for the simulation of bedload transport using the augmented Ro.pdf","","Augmented Roe schemes; Bedload transport models; Efficiency and robustness; Hydro-morphodynamical coupled equations; Sediment transport; SWE-Exner; sediment transport; shallow-water equation; Bed-load transport; 2D; Numerical Method; FVM; ACM; FCM; bedload; Equations of motion; finite volume method; Jacobians; hydrodynamics; two-dimensional modeling; Jacobian matrices; morphodynamics; Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions; Numerical methods; Numerical flux; Augmented roe scheme; Bedload transport model; comparative study; Computational efficiency; Efficiency; efficiency measurement; erodibility; Hydro-morphodynamical coupled equation; Intercell; Stability regions; Transport equation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Multilayer sedimentary beds are formed of different erodible soils with sediment properties and new exchange conditions between the bed layers are developed for the model. The coupled equations yield a hyperbolic system of balance laws with source terms. As a numerical solver for the system, we implement a fast finite volume characteristics method.

Morphodynamic boundary value problems are used to simultaneously model shallow water hydrodynamics and sediment transport processes in estuarine and coastal systems. The governing equations of interest arise when the two-dimensional Saint-Venant equations are tightly coupled to the corresponding Exner equation. The tight coupling of these two processes presents numerous modeling and analytical challenges. The resulting nonlinear system is incompletely parabolic, and contains a nonconservative product. In this work, some of these analytical challenges are tackled by applying a local discontinuous Galerkin method to the morphodynamic system; the quantities of interest and their gradients are solved separately.

Despite its limitations, the Saint-Venant-Exner system is still (and for sure for some years) widely used in industrial codes to model the bedload sediment transport. In practice, its numerical resolution is mostly handled by a splitting technique that allows a weak coupling between hydraulic and morphodynamic distinct softwares but may suffer from important stability issues. In recent works, many authors proposed alternative methods based on a strong coupling that cure this problem but are not so trivial to implement in an industrial context. In this work, we then pursue 2 objectives. First, we propose a very simple scheme based on an approximate Riemann solver, respecting the strong coupling framework, and we demonstrate its stability and accuracy through a number of numerical test cases. However, second, we reinterpret our scheme as a splitting technique and we extend the purpose to propose what should be the minimal coupling that ensures the stability of the global numerical process in industrial codes, at least, when dealing with collocated finite volume method. The resulting splitting method is, up to our knowledge, the only one for which stability properties are fully demonstrated.

The present formulation is identified as a semi-coupled approach because the projection method incorporates the change in the bed evolution in its approximation.

The physical problem is modeled through the shallow-water equations coupled with the Exner equation to describe the time evolution of the bed profile. The spatial discretization of the governing equations is carried out by a finite-volume method and a modified Roe scheme designed for non-conservative systems. As for the time advancing, starting from an explicit method, a linearized implicit scheme is generated, in which the flux Jacobian is computed through automatic differentiation. Second-order accuracy in space is then obtained through MUSCL reconstruction and in time through a backward differentiation formula associated with a defect-correction approach. The implicit time advancing is compared in terms of accuracy and computational time with the explicit approach for one-dimensional and two-dimensional sediment transport problems, characterized by different time scales for the evolution of the bed and of the water flow. It is shown that, whenever the use of large time steps is compatible with the capture of the water flow dynamics and of the bedload evolution, the implicit scheme is far more efficient than its explicit counterpart with a CPU reduction up to more than two orders of magnitude.

When coupling the equations, the SWE are considered but including an extra conservation law for the sediment dynamics. In this way the computational cost may become unrealistic in situations where the application of the SWE over rigid bed can be used involving large time and space scales without giving up to the adequate level of mesh refinement. Therefore, for restoring the numerical efficiency, the coupling technique is simplified, not decreasing the number of waves involved in the Riemann problem but simplifying their definitions.

In order to ensure the reliability of the numerical experimentation, the formulation has to be general enough to allow the use of different empirical laws.

It is already several years since the single-layered models have been used to model shallow water flows over erodible beds. Although such models present a real opportunity for shallow water flows over movable beds, this paper is the first to propose a multilayered solver for this class of flow problems. Design/methodology/approach: Multilayered beds formed with different erodible soils are considered in this study. The governing equations consist of the well-established shallow water equations for the flow, a transport equation for the suspended sediments, an Exner-type equation for the bed load and a set of empirical equations for erosion and deposition terms. For the numerical solution of the coupled system, the authors consider a non-homogeneous Riemann solver equipped with interface-tracking tools to resolve discontinuous soil properties in the multilayered bed. The solver consists of a predictor stage for the discretization of gradient terms and a corrector stage for the treatment of source terms. Findings: This paper reveals that modeling shallow water flows over multilayered sedimentary topography can be achieved by using a coupled system of partial differential equations governing sediment transport. The obtained results demonstrate that the proposed numerical model preserves the conservation property, and it provides accurate results, avoiding numerical oscillations and numerical dissipation in the approximated solutions. Originality/value: A novel implementation of sediment handling is presented where both averaged and separate values for sediment species are used to ensure speed and precision in the simulations. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","2020","2024-11-21 21:06:48","2024-12-01 00:35:50","","401 – 429","","2","37","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Publisher: Emerald Group Holdings Ltd.

The proposed model modifies the local topography at runtime wherever the levee is overtopped without having to predefine the position and shape of the breach. The model is implemented in CUDA programming language, so that simulations can be run on graphics processing units, guaranteeing fast execution times even for high-resolution meshes and large domains. The validation is performed based on several experimental tests, and numerical predictions are in good agreement with the measurements. The strengths and weaknesses of the proposed approach are also discussed by comparison with a sediment transport model based on the Exner equation: While the latter gives good results only for breaches forming in levees built with noncohesive material, the proposed model can also be applied to cohesive embankments. The application to a historical flood event is also presented, showing that the model can effectively be employed for real field simulations also in the case of multiple breaches.","2019-01","2024-11-21 21:26:47","2024-12-01 00:02:17","","682-702","","1","55","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: 2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA Publisher: AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION Type: Article","","C:\Users\johan\Zotero\storage\HBXJDIIM\Dazzi et al. - 2019 - Integration of a Levee Breach Erosion Model in a GPU-Accelerated 2D Shallow Water Equations Code.pdf","","Finite volume method; Sediment transport; SWE-Exner; shallow water equations; erosion; finite volume; flood simulation; GPU; levee breach; sediment transport; shallow-water equation; 2D shallow water equations; Shallow water equations; 2D; CUDA; Numerical Method; FVM; experimental study; Equations of motion; finite volume method; Floods; Two-dimensional shallow water equations; flood; Sediment transport model; Computer graphics; computer simulation; Embankments; Erosion; Flood simulation; Graphics processing unit; hardware; historical perspective; levee; Levee breaches; Levees; Material characteristics; Physically-based erosion model; Program processors; Shear stress; software; topography","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We show that, for some bedload transport models like the well-known Meyer-Peter and Müller model, the system is hyperbolic and, thus, linearly stable, only under some constraint on the velocity. In practical situations, this condition is hopefully fulfilled. Numerical approximations of such system are often based on a splitting method, solving first shallow water equation on a time step and, updating afterwards the topography. It is shown that this strategy can create spurious/unphysical oscillations which are related to the study of hyperbolicity. Using an upper bound of the largest eigenvector may improve the results although the instabilities cannot be always avoided, e.g. in supercritical regions.","2011","2024-11-21 21:48:33","2024-12-01 00:35:49","","980–989","","8","34","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: Elsevier","","C:\Users\johan\Zotero\storage\27ZC6E6I\Cordier et al. - 2011 - Bedload transport in shallow water models Why splitting (may) fail, how hyperbolicity (can) help.pdf","","Sediment transport; Exner equation; Stability; Hyperbolicity; Shallow water system; Splitting methods","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In addition, a new method is proposed for computing the water depth and velocity values along the shear wave.

Theoretical models based on two-dimensional shallow water and Exner equations have been successfully employed to capture the bar instability phenomenon, and to estimate bar properties such as height, wavelength and migration rate. However, the mathematical complexity of the problem hampered the understanding of the key physical mechanisms that sustain bar formation. To fill this gap, we considered a simplified version of the equations, based on neglecting the deformation of the free surface, which allows us to: (a) provide the first complete explanation of the bar formation mechanism as the result of a simple bond between variations of the water weight and flow acceleration; (b) derive a simplified, physically based formula for predicting bar formation in a river reach, depending on channel width-to-depth ratio, Shields number and relative submergence. Comparison with an unprecedented large set of laboratory experiments reveals that our simplified formula appropriately predicts alternate bar formation in a wide range of conditions. Noteworthy, the hypothesis of negligible free surface effect also implies that bar formation is fully independent of the Froude number. We show that this intriguing property is intimately related to the three-dimensional nature of river bars, which allows for a gentle lateral deviation of the flow without significant deformation of the water surface.","2021-12","2024-11-22 21:19:57","2024-12-01 00:02:10","","","","12","57","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: 2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA Publisher: AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION Type: Article","","C:\Users\johan\Zotero\storage\YA66ZL29\Redolfi - 2021 - Free Alternate Bars in Rivers Key Physical Mechanisms and Simple Formation Criterion.pdf","","sediment transport; river; instability; alternate bars; formation criterion; formation mechanism","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The presence of underlying bedrock strata covered by erodible bed layers is ubiquitous in rivers and estuaries. In the last years, the development of models based on the non-capacity sediment transport assumption, also called non-equilibrium assumption, has offered a new theoretical background to deal with complex non-erodible bed configurations and the associated numerical problems. Bedload non-capacity sediment transport models consider that the actual solid transport state can be different from the equilibrium state and depending on the temporal evolution of the flow. The treatment of finite-depth erodible bed layers, i.e. partially erodible beds, in bedload models based on the equilibrium approach has usually been made using numerical fixes, which correct the unphysical results obtained in some cases. Generally, the presence of a finite-depth erodible layer implies the introduction of a kind of non-equilibrium condition in the bedload transport state. Nevertheless, this common natural bed configuration has not been previously considered in the development of numerical models. In this work, a finite volume model (FVM) for bedload transport based on non-capacity approach and dealing with finite-depth erodible layers is proposed. New expressions for the actual bedload transport rate and the net exchange flux through the static-moving bed layers interface are used to develop a numerical scheme which solves the coupled shallow water and non-capacity bedload transport system of equations. The reconstruction of the intermediate states for the local Riemann problem at each intercell edge is designed to correctly model the presence of non-erodible strata, avoiding the appearance of unphysical results in the approximate solution without reducing the time step. The new coupled scheme is tested against laboratory benchmarking experiments in order to demonstrate its stability and accuracy, pointing out the properties of both equilibrium and non-equilibrium formulations.","2019-08","2024-11-22 21:19:57","2024-12-01 00:01:51","","91-112","","","130","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND Publisher: ELSEVIER SCI LTD Type: Article","","C:\Users\johan\Zotero\storage\9PASBC3D\Martinez-Aranda et al. - 2019 - A comparative analysis of capacity and non-capacity formulations for the simulation of unsteady flow.pdf","","Finite volume method; Shallow water equations; Augmented Roe's scheme; Finite-depth erodible layer; Fully coupled method; Non-capacity bedload transport","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In these conditions bed load is the dominant mode of sediment transport. Laboratory experiments of a single bore-driven swash event are simulated numerically using a fully-coupled model that solves the system of Non Linear Shallow Water Equations and the Exner sediment conservation formula. The analysis focuses on two aspects: the optimal choice of parameters for the Meyer-Peter and Muller sediment transport formula and the model used for computing the shear stress. The methods tested for the bed shear stress are the momentum integral method and the Chezy formulation in which the friction factor is computed using two different formulae. Infiltration into the beach and its effects on the shear stress and sediment transport are also modelled. Results show that the basic Meyer-Peter and Muller sediment transport formula provides good results in the run-up. On the other hand, the sediment transport in the early stage of the backwash is overestimated. A reduction of the sediment mobility constant in the formula in the backwash marginally improves the results. However, the causes of the overestimation of the sediment transport at the early stage of the backwash is the overestimation of the shear stress, while at later stages there are several contributions that are identified, i.e. modelling of the sediment transport and infiltration. It is also suggested that the Meyer-Peter and Muller sediment transport formula might not capture the complexity of the processes involved during the backwash. The comparison of the methods for the estimate of the bed shear stress show that comparable results can be obtained using the momentum integral method and the Chezy formulation with time and space varying friction factor. The resulting bed evolution is also described. In the predicted final profile, deposition is found in the upper part of the beach and erosion in the lower part. A bed step is formed just below the position of the initial shoreline. This feature is determined by the onset of a hydraulic jump during the backwash.","2018-12","2024-11-22 21:19:57","2024-12-01 00:02:23","","62-76","","","142","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS Publisher: ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV Type: Article","","C:\Users\johan\Zotero\storage\YCUM89LA\Briganti et al. - 2018 - Numerical modelling of the flow and bed evolution of a single bore-driven swash event on a coarse sa.pdf","","Bed load; Swash zone; Morphodynamics; Coarse sediment beach","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A multi-scale analysis is performed in order to take into account that the velocity of the sediment layer is smaller than the one of the fluid layer. This leads us to consider a shallow water type system for the fluid layer and a lubrication Reynolds equation for the sediment one. This deduction provides some improvements with respect to the classic Saint-Venant-Exner model: (i) the deduced model has an associated energy. Moreover, it allows us to explain why classic models do not have an associated energy and how they can be modified in order to recover a model with this property. (ii) The model incorporates naturally a necessary modification that must be taken into account in order to be applied to arbitrarily sloping beds. Furthermore, we show that in general this modification is different from the ones considered classically. Nevertheless, it coincides with a classic one in the case of constant free surface. (iii) The deduced solid transport discharge naturally depends on the thickness of the moving sediment layer, which allows to ensure sediment mass conservation. Moreover, we include a simplified version of the model for the case of quasi-stationary regimes. Some of these simplified models correspond to a generalization of classic ones such as Meyer-Peter and Muller and Ashida-Michiue models. Three numerical tests are presented to study the evolution of a dune for several definition of the repose angle, to see the influence of the proposed definition of the effective shear stress in comparison with the classic one, and by comparing with experimental data.","2017-02","2024-11-22 21:19:57","2024-12-01 00:02:10","","115-145","","1","51","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: 17, AVE DU HOGGAR, PA COURTABOEUF, BP 112, F-91944 LES ULIS CEDEX A, FRANCE Publisher: EDP SCIENCES S A Type: Article","","C:\Users\johan\Zotero\storage\S93ARP7R\Fernandez-Nieto et al. - 2017 - FORMAL DEDUCTION OF THE SAINT-VENANT-EXNER MODEL INCLUDING ARBITRARILY SLOPING SEDIMENT BEDS AND ASS.pdf","","Saint-Venant-Exner; bedload; Reynolds equation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Then, the water motion in shallow domains is described by the Saint-Venant equations. This coupling bringing the bottom sea changes is based on the assumption that the bed adapts to the flow in order to minimise some energy quantity together with minimal sand transport. The approach is shown being equivalent to the use of an Exner equation for the bed with a non-local expression for the sediment transport flux.

The governing equation is the modified 1D shallow water equation and the Exner equation that take both bed load and suspended load transport into account. The non-equilibrium sediment transport algorithm was adopted in the model, and the van Rijn method was employed to calculate the bed-load transport rate and the concentration of suspended sediment at the reference level. Flux terms in the governing equations were discretised using the upwind flux scheme, Harten et al. (1983) (HLL) and HLLC schemes, Roe's scheme and the Weighted Average Flux (WAF) schemes with the Double Minmod and Minmod flux limiters. The model was tested under a fixed bed condition to evaluate the performance of several different numerical schemes and then applied to an experimental case of dam break flow over a mobile bed and a flood event in the Rillito River, Tucson, Arizona. For dam break flow over movable bed, all tested schemes were proved to be capable of reasonably simulating water surface profiles, but failed to accurately capture the hydraulic jump. The WAF schemes produced slight spurious oscillations at the water surface and bed profiles and over-estimated the scour depth. When applying the model to the Rillito River, the simulated results generally agreed well with the field measurements of flow discharges and bed elevation changes.

It is shown that a well balanced 2D model can predict flow features, sediment and scalar concentration, and bed elevation with an accuracy that is suitable for practical river engineering. The term “balanced” implies that important physical processes are modeled with a similar degree of complexity and exhaustiveness. The starting point of the model formulation is the assumption of self-similarity of vertical velocity profiles (horizontal velocities in the longitudinal and transverse directions), that are scaled by shear velocity and streamline curvature, both resolved by the model. The former is scaled by a bed-resistance coefficient that must be estimated or calibrated - as usual on a application-specific basis, and the latter is computed by a new, grid-based but grid orientation independent, scheme that acts on the discrete solution. All processes, including bottom shear, momentum dispersion, scalar dispersion, turbulent diffusion, bed load, and suspended load, are modeled using physically based, averaged values of empirical or semi-empirical constants, and consistently with the assumed velocity profiles (and bed-generated turbulence). Bed deformation modeling can be implemented with either an equilibrium or non-equilibrium formulation of the Exner equation, depending on the adaptation length scale, which must be taken under consideration if significantly larger than the length scale of the spatial discretization. The governing equations are solved by high-resolution, unstructured-grid Godunov method, which is elsewhere tested and shown to be reliable and second-order accurate. Application of the model to laboratory test cases, using standard parameter values and previously reported bed-resistance coefficients, gives results comparable to many 2D and 3D models previously applied to the same cases, most part of which benefit from case-specific parameter tuning. There are obviously intrinsic limits to the descriptive ability of 2D models in river modeling, but the results of this study point to the utility and cost-effectiveness of a well-designed 2D model.

The analysis is usually conducted focusing the asymptotic fate of small disturbances, using normal modes. In this work we instead have tackled another aspect of the stability problem studying the disturbance behavior at finite times. Recent studies have in fact shown that nonnormality of differential operators can induce a nonmonotonic decay of disturbances in asymptotically stable cases and the occurrence of transient growths. We have investigated these aspects for the de Saint-Venant-Exner equations and discussed the transient behavior of the energy of disturbances for both fixed and movable bed conditions. We show that the former case provides weak levels of nonnormality; while the latter can give rise to important transient growths. These growths result from uniquely linear mechanisms, are potentially able to trigger nonlinear instabilities, and are physically due to a transfer of potential energy between the water stream and the bed. The results encourage revisiting the study of morphodynamics from a nonmodal perspective.","2009-08-13","2024-11-22 21:19:58","2024-12-01 00:02:20","","","","","45","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: 2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA Publisher: AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION Type: Article","","C:\Users\johan\Zotero\storage\X7M5C2DZ\Camporeale and Ridolfi - 2009 - Nonnormality and transient behavior of the de Saint-Venant-Exner equations.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The set of governing equations is solved using an explicit finite difference scheme. The model is tested in various idealized experimental cases, with fairly good agreement between the numerical predictions and measurements. Discrepancies are observed at the earlier stage of the dam-break wave and around the dam location due to no vertical velocity component being taken into account. Sensitivity tests confirm that the friction coefficient is an important parameter for the evaluation of sediment transport processes operating during a dam-break wave. The influence of the non-equilibrium adaptation length (or the lag distance) is negligible on the wavefront celerity and weak on the free surface and bed profiles, which indicates that one may ignore the spatial lag effect in dam-break wave studies. Finally, the simulation of the Lake Ha!Ha! dyke-break flood event shows that the model can provide relevant results if a convenient formula for computing the sediment transport capacity and an appropriate median grain diameter of riverbed material are selected.","2008-04","2024-11-22 21:19:58","2024-12-01 00:02:27","","169-198","","2","8","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS Publisher: SPRINGER Type: Article","","C:\Users\johan\Zotero\storage\8JMEUDGM\Abderrezzak et al. - 2008 - One-dimensional numerical modelling of dam-break waves over movable beds application to experimenta.pdf","","sediment transport; dam-break wave; Ha!Ha!

The one-dimensional de Saint Venant and Exner equations are solved numerically for the ideal case of a frictionally dominated estuary consisting of noncohesive sediment and with insignificant intertidal storage of water in tidal flats and salt marshes. This class of estuaries turns out to be invariably flood dominated. The resulting asymmetries in surface elevations and tidal currents lead to a net sediment flux within a tidal cycle which is directed landward. As a consequence, sediments are trapped within the estuary and the bottom profile evolves asymptotically toward an equilibrium configuration, allo wing a vanishing net sediment flux everywhere and, in accordance with field observations, a nearly constant value of the maximum flood/ebb speed. Such an equilibrium bed profile is characterized by a concavity increasing as the estuary convergence increases and by a uniquely determined value of the depth at the inlet section. The final length of the estuary is fixed by the longitudinal extension of the very shallow area which tends to form in the landward portion of the estuary. Note that sediment advection is neglected in the analysis, an assumption appropriate to the case of not too fine sediment.","2002-01-15","2024-11-22 21:19:58","2024-12-01 00:02:19","","","","C1","107","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: 2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA Publisher: AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION Type: Article","","C:\Users\johan\Zotero\storage\56JBTKWU\Lanzoni and Seminara - 2002 - Long-term evolution and morphodynamic equilibrium of tidal channels.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Besides describing the model, we ran it for four different test cases: a steady flow on an inclined bed leading to aggradation or degradation, a dam-break leading to high interaction between the flow and the bed, a dam-break with a symmetrical enlargement close to the gate and a dam-break in a channel with a 90 degrees bend. The gathered results are discussed and compared to an existing fully coupled approach based on HLLC fluxes. Although both models equally perform regarding water levels, the weakly coupled model looks to better predict the bed evolution for the four test cases.

The mathematical expressions modeling the hydrodynamic and morphodynamic components of the physical phenomenon are treated to deal with cross-section shape variations and empirical solid discharge estimations. The resulting coupled equations can be rewritten as a non-conservative hyperbolic system with three moving waves and one stationary wave to account for the source terms discretization. Moreover, the wave celerities for the coupled morpho-hydrodyamical system depend on the erosion-deposition mechanism selected to update the channel cross-section profile. This influence is incorporated into the system solution by means of a new parameter related to the channel bottom variation celerity. Special interest is put to show that, even for the simplest solid transport models as the Grass law, to find a linearized Jacobian matrix of the system can be a challenge in presence of arbitrary shape channels. In this paper a numerical finite volume scheme is proposed, based on an augmented Roe solver, first order accurate in time and space, dealing with solid transport flux variations caused by the channel geometry changes. Channel cross-section variations lead to the appearance of a new solid flux source term which should be discretized properly. The stability region is controlled by wave celerities together with a proper reconstruction of the approximate local Riemann problem solution, enforcing positive values for the intermediate states of the conserved variables. Comparison of the numerical results for several analytical and experimental cases demonstrates the effectiveness, exact well-balancedness and accuracy of the scheme. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

A general Shallow Water Exner moment model allowing for polynomial velocity profiles of arbitrary order is obtained. A regularization ensures hyperbolicity and easy computation of the eigenvalues. The system is solved by means of an adapted IFCP scheme proposed here. The improvement of this IFCP type scheme is based on the approximation of the eigenvalue associated to the sediment transport.

On the one hand, the equilibrium approach for the bedload transport assumes that the actual transport rate instantaneously adapts to the local flow features. The resulting system of equations, composed of the shallow water equations for the flow (SWE) and the Exner equation for the bed evolution, has been widely used to simulate bedload processes. These capacity SWE + Exner models are highly dependent on the setup parameters, so that the calibration procedure often disguises the advantages and flaws of the numerical method. On the other hand, noncapacity approaches account for the temporal and spatial delay of the actual sediment transport rate with respect to the capacity of the flow. The importance of assuming nonequilibrium conditions in bedload numerical models remains uncertain however. In this work, we compared the performances of three different strategies for the resolution of the SWE + Exner system under capacity and noncapacity conditions to approximate a set of experimental data with fixed setup parameters.

Due to the coupling effect among tidal currents, waves, and sediments, an immense sandbar area evolved in the outer subaqueous delta, impeding the flood releasing during wet season, as well as salinity intrusion during the dry season. In this work, an unstructured-grid based morphodynamic model was proposed to simulate the sandbar evolution process in the Modaomen Estuary. The proposed model was constructed by using the two-dimensional shallow water equations for tidal flow, the advection-diffusion equations for salinity and suspended sediment transport, and the non-equilibrium formulation of the Exner equation for bed evolution. To simulate the wave-induced longshore currents in the Modaomen Estuary, an adaptive time-stepping approach was proposed to couple the unstructured-grid based Simulating WAves Nearshore (SWAN) model and the shallow flow model. An integrated solver is proposed for computing flow, salinity, and sediment transport fluxes simultaneously, and then the shallow water equations and advection-diffusion equations are jointly solved by a high-resolution, unstructured-grid Godunov method. Application of the model to the Modaomen Estuary, using calibrated parameter values, gives results comparable to the measured data. The butterfly shape of the sandbar in the Modaomen Estuary is considerably well simulated by the proposed model, which matches well with the measured topography.","2018-05","2024-12-01 00:01:08","2024-12-01 00:01:08","","","","5","10","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND Publisher: MDPI Type: Article","","C:\Users\johan\Zotero\storage\HITGI6KA\Hu et al. - 2018 - An Unstructured-Grid Based Morphodynamic Model for Sandbar Simulation in the Modaomen Estuary, China.pdf","","Godunov method; morphodynamic model; Modaomen Estuary; Pearl River; sandbar simulation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

According to the path choices, we exhibit several shock definitions and we prove that a shock with a constant propagation speed and a given left state may connect an arbitrary right state. As a consequence, additional assumptions (coming from physical considerations or other arguments) must be chosen to enforce a unique definition.

The integrator allows for the exact balance of energy exchanges in space and time for vertical atmospheric motions by preserving the skew-symmetry of the non-canonical Hamiltonian formulation of the compressible Euler equations. The performance of the integrator is accelerated by a preconditioning strategy that reduces the dimensionality of the inner linear system. Here we reduce the four component velocity, density, density weighted potential temperature and Exner pressure system into a single equation for the density weighted potential temperature via repeated Schur complement decomposition and the careful selection of coupling terms. As currently formulated, the integrator is based on a horizontal-vertical spatial splitting that does not permit bottom topography. The integrator is validated for standard test cases for baroclinic instability and a non-hydrostatic gravity wave on the sphere and a rising bubble in a high-resolution planar geometry, and shows robust convergence across all of these regimes.

The hydrodynamic model is developed by solving the two dimensional (2D) shallow water equations using a total variation diminishing (TVD) MacCormack predictor corrector scheme. The present TVD method is very simple and provides accurate results free from numerical oscillations near sharp gradient. The effective stresses are modeled by using a constant eddy viscosity model. The sediment transport model solves the Exner equation using a simple forward time and central space (FTCS) finite difference algorithm. The sediment transport model incorporates the helical flow and the transverse bed slope effects on the sediment direction computation. These models are coupled using the semicoupled approach. The present semicoupled model is used to replicate two popular experimental test cases of both tight and loose channel bends. The obtained results in terms of bed level variation reveal that the model can accurately simulate several features of the bed changes such as oscillations of the transverse bed profile with the formation of point bars and pools along the banks. The values obtained for three widely used statistical parameters show the applicability of the present model for this type of complex scenarios.","2020-09","2024-12-01 00:01:08","2024-12-01 00:01:08","","1611-1622","","5","13","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: MECHANICAL ENGINEEING DEPT, JAFM OFFICE, ISFAHAN, 84156-83111, IRAN Publisher: ISFAHAN UNIV TECHNOLOGY Type: Article","","C:\Users\johan\Zotero\storage\3MQ25AZ9\Bora and Kalita - 2020 - A Semi-Coupled Model for Morphological Flow Simulation in River Bend.pdf","","Exner equation; Shallow water equations; Sediment transport model; FTCS scheme; Semicoupled model; TVD MacCormack scheme","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These conditions allow the generation of incident signals and the absorption of reflected ones, taking into account the bed evolution at the boundary. They use the approximations for linear waves in shallow water and are based on the solution of the Riemann Equations. The proposed technique is implemented in the fully-coupled hydro-morphodynamical numerical model of Briganti et al. (2012a). Firstly, the generation and absorption of single monochromatic waves are studied to quantify the error after the reflected wave exited the domain. In all cases the error is always small, giving evidence of the effectiveness of the new seaward boundary conditions. Furthermore, the propagation and reflection of a monochromatic wave train over a mobile bed are considered. Both flow evolution and bed change are not affected by spurious oscillations when long sequences of waves are tested. Additionally, a very low mobility bed is considered to simulate a `virtually fixed' bed and new boundary condition results consistently converge to those for the hydrodynamic only case. Finally, the reflection of a uniform bore over a mobile bed is studied. For this case the Rankine Hugoniot conditions provide an analytical solution. It is apparent that the adopted linear approximations produce errors in the velocity estimates. Nevertheless, the conditions perform reasonably well even in this demanding non-linear case.

The present study investigates, using 2D shallow-water approximation, the morphodynamics and forces caused by a dam-break wave against a rigid obstacle in the presence of an erodible bed. A widely used coupled equilibrium model, based on the two-dimensional Saint-Venant hydrodynamic equations combined with the sediment continuity Exner equation (SVEM), is compared with a more complex two-phase model (TPM). Considering an experimental set-up presented in the literature with a single rigid obstacle in a channel, two series of tests were performed, assuming sand or light sediments on the bottom. The former test is representative of a typical laboratory experiment, and the latter may be scaled up to a field case. For each test, two different particle diameters were considered. Independently from the particle size, it was found that in the sand tests, SVEM performs similarly to TPM. In the case of light sediment, larger differences are observed, and the SVEM predicts a higher force of about 26% for both considered diameters. The analysis of the flow fields and the morphodynamics shows these differences can be essentially ascribed to the role of inertia of the solid particles.","2021-01","2024-12-01 00:01:08","2024-12-01 00:01:08","","","","2","13","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND Publisher: MDPI Type: Article","","C:\Users\johan\Zotero\storage\GCRD27W8\Di Cristo et al. - 2021 - Impact Force of a Geomorphic Dam-Break Wave against an Obstacle Effects of Sediment Inertia.pdf","","Exner equation; dam-break; mobile bed; impact force; two-phase model","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The model consists of the Saint-Venant system governing the water flow coupled with the Exner equation for the sediment transport. One of the main difficulties in designing good numerical methods for such models is related to the fact that the speed of water surface gravity waves is typically much faster than the speed at which the changes in the bottom topography occur. This imposes a severe stability restriction on the size of time steps, which, in turn, leads to excessive numerical diffusion that affects the computed bottom structure. In order to overcome this difficulty, we develop an operator splitting approach for the underlying coupled system, which allows one to treat slow and fast waves in a different manner and using different time steps. Our method is based on the application of a finite-volume central-upwind scheme introduced in [A. Kurganov and G. Petrova, Commun. Math.

The problem is solved using EFG meshfree method, in which the problem domain is represented by a set of arbitrarily distributed nodes; there is no need to use meshes, elements, or any other node connectivity information for field variable interpolation. The EFG method is based on moving least-squares (MLS) shape functions originated in scattered data fitting.

The SVE system (SVEs) under some considerations, is a nonconservative hyperbolic system of nonlinear partial differential equations. This model is widely used in coastal engineering to simulate the interaction of fluid flow with sediment beds. It is well known that SVEs requires a robust treatment of nonconservative terms. Some efficient numerical schemes have been proposed to overcome the difficulties related to these terms. However, the main drawbacks of these schemes are what follows: (i) Lack of robustness, (ii) Generation of non-physical diffusions, (iii) Presence of instabilities within numerical solutions. This collection of drawbacks weakens the efficiency of most numerical methods proposed in the literature. To overcome these drawbacks a reformulation of the central-upwind scheme for SVEs (CU-SVEs for short) in a path-conservative version is presented in this work. We first develop a finite-volume method of the first order and then extend it to the second order via the averaging essentially non oscillatory (AENO) framework. Our numerical approach is shown to be well-balanced positivity-preserving and shock-capturing. The resulting scheme could be seen as a predictor-corrector method. The accuracy and robustness of the scheme are assessed a selected suite of tests.","2022-09","2024-12-01 00:01:08","2024-12-01 00:01:08","","359-384","","3","12","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: PO BOX 33, YUSEONG, DAEJEON 305-600, SOUTH KOREA Publisher: TECHNO-PRESS Type: Article","","C:\Users\johan\Zotero\storage\I2VD88IS\Ndengna and Njifenjou - 2022 - A well-balanced PCCU-AENO scheme for a sediment transport model.pdf","","Saint-Venant-Exner model; AENO reconstruction procedure; path-conservative central-upwind scheme; sediment transport processes","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The discretization of the bed slope source term is based on the HR method to preserve the still water steady-state solution. The hydrodynamic model described by the Saint-Venant system is numerically solved using the well-balanced unstaggered central scheme proposed in Dong and Li (2020). The morphodynamic model described by the Exner equation is numerically solved by using a Lax-Friedrichs method. In solving the morphodynamic model, we proposed a novel “cut-off” function to guarantee the nonlinear stability and preserve the stationary solution. The present scheme can exactly obtain the stationary solution and is capable of guaranteeing the positivity of the water depth. The key contributions of this work are the well-balanced property at the wet-dry fronts and the stability of the current scheme in solving two physical models that have relatively either strong or weak interactions.

Here, we study the basic mechanism that governs the evolution of topographic and expansions and explore the instability of the bottom topography under conditions of steady but spatially expanding flow. We model the expanding flow via a by configuration where water and sediments are supplied from a central hole and flow on a cone shaped surface confined by lateral walls. The governing equations are the shallow-water equations coupled with the Exner equation, written in cylindrical coordinates. We initially approach the problem analytically by considering the conditions required for the basic state, consisting of a pure radial flow and bottom profile, to lose stability to small amplitude perturbations. This analysis suggests that more than one mode may be unstable, encouraging us to extend the analysis to the nonlinear regime. We do this through numerical modeling of the full governing equations, which allows us to predict the establishment of a bar pattern whose features are similar to those experimentally observed. Two prominent features of the finite-amplitude bar pattern are (1) bar apices are distributed at a radial distance from the inflow consistent with work of Shaw et al. (2018); and (2) that the flow aspect ratio of the interbar areas remain high without provoking further instability. Both features imply that in general expansion acts to reduce bar development relative to an equivalent rectilinear flow.

The near-bed transport region is represented by the lower (bedload) layer which has an arbitrarily constant, vanishing thickness (of approx. 10 times the sediment particle diameter), and whose average sediment concentration is free to vary. Sediment is allowed to enter the upper layer, and hence the total load may also be simulated, provided that concentrations of suspended sediment remain low. The model conforms with established theories of bedload, and is validated satisfactorily against empirical expressions for sediment transport rates and the morphodynamic experiment of a migrating mining pit by Lee et al.

Investigation into the effect of a local bed gradient on bedload leads to derivation of an analytical, physically meaningful expression for morphological diffusion induced by a non-zero local bed slope. Incorporation of the proposed morphological diffusion into a conventional morphodynamic model (defined as a coupling between the shallow water equations, Exner equation and an empirical formula for bedload) improves model predictions when applied to the evolution of a mining pit, without the need either to resort to special numerical treatment of the equations or to use additional tuning parameters.","2018-02","2024-12-01 00:01:08","2024-12-01 00:01:08","","","","2","5","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: 6-9 CARLTON HOUSE TERRACE, LONDON SW1Y 5AG, ENGLAND Publisher: ROYAL SOC Type: Article","","C:\Users\johan\Zotero\storage\W25JVE5J\Maldonado and Borthwick - 2018 - Quasi-two-layer morphodynamic model for bedload-dominated problems bed slope-induced morphological.pdf","","bedload; morphodynamics; bed slope; morphological diffusion","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The equations are written in terms of potential temperature and Exner function. The time stepping is accomplished with the EPI2 and EPI3 schemes which have been used in the past for very accurate, long time step integration of the shallow water equations on the sphere. The stability of exponential integrators of this class is ensured by approximation of the oscillatory term using an absolutely stable exponential formula. Consequently, the schemes are not subject to the CFL condition imposed by the linear oscillatory part of the system and they also eliminate the phase errors associated with all the known implicit time stepping algorithms. All calculations are performed using the phipm algorithm based on the Krylov space methods. It is shown that the spectral radius of the Jacobian and consequently the Krylov space dimension are very sensitive to the presence of spatial noise. Efficiency and accuracy increase after the Shapiro filter is applied every two time steps. The method is investigated using several standardized and well accepted benchmark tests, including convective bubbles and a cold density current proposed by Straka and collaborators. Numerical experiments show that a stable integration is obtained for the wave Courant number of the order of 60 to 250. We present a detailed discussion of the development of a cold density current capturing the spiraling Prandtl vortex and the subsequent appearance of the Kelvin-Helmholtz billows. Our results from the exponential method compare very well with those obtained from the accurate schemes reported in the recent literature. The algorithm accurately handles both advection as well as acoustic and gravity waves. These results warrant the further development of the scheme for modeling atmospheric processes on a wide range of scales.

Complex interactions between tides, waves and shallow bathymetry often drive fast morphological changes but the underlying processes remain only partly understood. To better understand these processes, the development and application of morphodynamic models represents a unique perspective. This paper evaluates the impact of recent developments in the modelling system SCHISM, which include: a WENO method to solve the Exner Equation, a 3D coupling between waves and currents using a vortex force formalism, an adaptive parameterization for the dissipation of short waves by breaking and improved representations for wave-induced sediment transport. In order to evaluate the relevance of these developments, SCHISM is applied to the Maumusson Inlet, a mixed-energy inlet located on the Western Coast of France. Model-data comparison reveals firstly that complex wave-current interactions take place over the inlet ebb-delta, that include partial wave blocking during the ebb. Compared to classical 2DH approaches, our improved modelling system better reproduces the dynamics of adjacent beaches, inlet migration under oblique waves and sediment infilling of the main channel under storm waves. The relevance of these developments is demonstrated at the mixed-energy Maumusson Inlet (France).","2020","2024-12-01 00:01:09","2024-12-01 00:01:09","","1016-1020","","95","","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: 5130 NW 54TH STREET, COCONUT CREEK, FL 33073 USA Publisher: COASTAL EDUCATION & RESEARCH FOUNDATION Type: Article","","","","sediment transport; morphodynamic modelling; Tidal inlet; wave-current interactions","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The hydrodynamic model solves the three-dimensional shallow water equations (SWEs) using a finite volume method on prismatic cells in sigma-coordinates. The morphodynamic model solves an Exner equation consisting of bed-load sediment transportation. Using a relaxation approach, a hyperbolic system is built for hydrodynamic system, which allows for using a Godunov-type central-upwind method to capture the shocks and approximate the numerical fluxes. Consequently, the 3D-SWEs-Exner model proposed in the present study can stably and accurately solve the dam-break flows over mobile beds. A spatially and temporally second-order “prismatic” central-upwind method is used to approximate the numerical fluxes through cell interfaces. The Exner equation is solved using an upwind method. Using spatially linear reconstruction and explicit two-stage Runge-Kutta time discretization, second order accuracy is achieved in space and time. The proposed model can preserve the well-balanced property due to the special discretization of bed-slope source terms. The proposed model is validated by several tests with experimental measurements, and is compared with the simulated results using reported two-dimensional (2-D) models. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

To test these different approaches we use a suitable set of test cases. Three of them are presented here: a test with a smooth analytical solution, a Riemann problem with analytical solution and a test in which the Froude number approaches unity.

Accordingly, the shallow-water hydrodynamic equations are coupled with the Exner equation for mass conservation of the sediment. The system of equations is solved using a fully coupled well-balanced finite volume method, second-order accurate in time and space. The effect of the steep bed slope of a dam face is incorporated into both the hydrodynamics and sediment transport equations, leading to improved predictions. Comparison with results obtained from nonequilibrium sediment transport models indicates that such models perform poorly while predicting the bed evolution near the toe of an eroding dam. Observations from experimental studies demonstrate that the amount of sediment entrained by the flow is not significant, except during the initial moments of failure. This suggests that the vertical exchange of mass between the bed and the flow layer, as assumed by the nonequilibrium models, may not be completely valid during the failure. The equilibrium model results, reproducing the key flow features of the overtopping failure process, are validated by experimental measurements. The study provides fresh insights into the sediment transport processes associated with the erosion of a granular dam by overtopping, establishes the appropriateness of the equilibrium approach for its numerical modeling, and proposes a well-balanced second-order accurate solution technique for solving the resulting coupled equations of flow and sediment transport.","2021-04","2024-12-01 00:01:09","2024-12-01 00:01:09","","","","4","33","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: 1305 WALT WHITMAN RD, STE 300, MELVILLE, NY 11747-4501 USA Publisher: AMER INST PHYSICS Type: Article","","C:\Users\johan\Zotero\storage\5MY74M9U\Biswas et al. - 2021 - Equilibrium approach for modeling erosional failure of granular dams.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The coupled method uses a coupling of the governing equations at the same time step leading to a non-conservative solution. The splitting method solves the Exner and the shallow water equations in a separate manner, and is only capable of modeling weak free-surface and bedload interactions. In the current study, an extended version of a Godunov-type wave propagation algorithm is presented for modeling of morphodynamic systems using both coupled and splitting approaches. In the introduced coupled method the entire morphodynamic system is solved in the form of a conservation law. For the splitting technique, a new wave Riemann decomposition is defined which enables the scheme to be utilized for mild and strong interactions. To consider the bedload sediment discharge within the Exner equation, the Smart and Meyer-Peter & Muller formulae are used. It was found that the coupled solution gives accurate predictions for all investigated flow regimes including propagation over a dry-state using a Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy (CFL) number equal to 0.6. Furthermore, the splitting method was able to model all flow regimes with a lower CFL number of 0.3.

The model is devised for compound channels modeling: cross-section overbanks are treated with fixed bed conditions, while the main channel is left free to modify its morphology. A capacitive approach is used for bed load transport modeling, in which the solid flow rates are estimated with bed load transport formulas. The model equations pose some numerical issues in the case of natural channels, where bed load transport may occur for both subcritical and supercritical flows and geometry varies in space. An explicit path-conservative scheme, designed to overcome all these issues, is presented in the paper. The scheme solves liquid and solid phases dynamics in a coupled manner, in order to correctly model near critical currents/channel interactions and is well-balanced, that is able to properly reproduce steady states. The Roe and Osher Riemann solvers are implemented, so as to take into account the spatial geometry variations of natural channels. The scheme reaches up to second-order accuracy. Validation is performed with fixed and movable bed test cases whose analytical solution is known, and with flume experimental data.

Indeed, it induces a fast transient flow that may entrain large amounts of sediments and modify the valley morphology. The understanding of the interaction between such a rapid flow and the sediment transport remains a challenge for fluvial hydraulics. A combined approach of laboratory, theoretical and numerical modelling is still needed to predict the geomorphic consequences of a dam failure, mainly in a complex topography. A laboratory study of a dam-break wave expanding over a flat mobile bed in a floodplain was conducted in the Hydraulics Laboratory, Institute of Mechanics, Materials and Civil Engineering, Universite catholique de Louvain, Belgium. The flume was 3.6 m wide and about 36 m long. The rising gate featuring the dam break was 1 m wide, inducing a wave expanding longitudinally as well as transversally. An initial 85 mm layer of coarse sand was put down upon the fixed bed from 1 m upstream to 9 m downstream of the gate representing the dam. Two cases were simulated: (1) an initial water level of 47 cm above the fixed bed in the upstream reservoir and no water downstream; (2) an initial water level of 51 cm in the upstream reservoir and a water level of 15 cm downstream. Time evolution of the water level was measured at 8 points by means of ultrasonic gauges and the final topography was measured by a bed profiler every 5 cm. Only bed-load transport was observed in these experiments. This laboratory test was carried out as a benchmark experiment in NSF-Pire project (http://pire.ce.sc.edu/) and allowed two-dimensional (2D) numerical models from several authors to be analysed. Among these models, two shallow-water models are here compared in details. In the first model, a clear-water layer approach is used: the Saint-Venant-Exner (SVE) equations are solved, using a Manning formula for the friction source term and a Meyer-Peter-Muller closure equation based on an equilibrium solid transport assumption. The second model is a two-layer model (2L), where the flow is described along a vertical by three regions of homogeneous properties separated by sharp interfaces. The upper layer is made of clear water while the lower layer, standing for the bed-load transport layer, is a mixture of water and moving sediments. These layers flow over a motionless bed. Both models are solved on unstructured triangular meshes by a finite-volume scheme with a lateralized Harten-Lax-Van Leer (HLL) flux computation. Interesting conclusions may arise from comparisons between both models and comparisons with laboratory observations. The main features experimentally observed are captured by the numerical models. The water level evolution is better reproduced by the two-layer model than by the SVE model. The final deposition crests near the walls are still difficult to predict by both models.","2013","2024-12-01 00:01:09","2024-12-01 00:01:09","","4485-4494","","","","","","","","","","","TSINGHUA UNIV","DEPT BUILDING SCI, SCH ARCHITECTURE, SECRETARIAT ISHVAC07, BEIJING, 100084, PEOPLES R CHINA","English","","","","","","","Backup Publisher: Minist Water Resources; China Inst Water Resources & Hydropower Res; Sichuan Univ; Tsinghua Univ; Univ Hong Kong; Chengdu Municipal Peoples Govt Type: Proceedings Paper","","","","Sediment transport; Finite volume; Dam-break flow; Mobile bed; 2D models","","Zhaoyin, W; Lee, JHW; Jizhang, G; Shuyou, C","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Then, the Exner equation is included to take into account bedload sediment transport. Finally, source terms for friction, erosion and deposition processes are considered. Indeed, observe that the sediment particle could go in suspension into the water or being deposited on the bottom. For the numerical scheme, we rely on well-balanced Lagrange-projection methods. In particular, since sediment transport is generally a slow process, we aim to develop semi-implicit schemes in order to obtain fast simulations. The Lagrange-projection splitting is well-suited for such a purpose as it entails a decomposition of the (fast) acoustic waves and the (slow) material waves of the model. Hence, in subsonic regimes, an implicit approximation of the acoustic equations allows us to neglect the corresponding CFL condition and to obtain fast numerical schemes with large time step.","2023-11","2024-12-01 00:01:09","2024-12-01 00:01:09","","1087-1126","","4","16","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: Office B, 9/F, Kings Wing Plaza2, No.1 On Kwan St, Shek Mun, NT, Hong Kong, 00000, PEOPLES R CHINA Publisher: GLOBAL SCIENCE PRESS Type: Article","","C:\Users\johan\Zotero\storage\3V4SBL52\Del Grosso et al. - 2023 - On Lagrange-Projection Schemes for Shallow Water Flows Over Movable Bottom with Suspended and Bedloa.pdf","","Shallow water flows; erosion-deposition processes; implicit-explicit schemes; Lagrange-projection schemes; movable bottom","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The transport of sediment loads is described by the nonlinear Exner equation, generalized to the case of a spatially inhomogeneous distribution of the parameters of the underlying surface. For numerical integration of the Saint-Venant and Exner equations, a stable and well-tested CSPH-TVD method of the second order of accuracy is used, the parallel CUDA algorithm of which is implemented as the software package “EcoGIS-Simulation” for high-performance computing on supercomputers with graphics processor units (GPU). Hydrodynamic modeling of the processes of erosion of the enclosing dam of a real hydraulic facility and flooding of adjacent territories is carried out. The parameters of penetration of the enclosing dam and flooding zones, formed as a result of the development of a hydraulic accident at the tailing dump, are determined. Based on the obtained results, it is concluded that the proposed method for numerical modeling of the joint dynamics of surface water and traction sediment can be more universal and efficient (has significantly better accuracy and performance) compared to available methods for calculating the parameters of the washout and flood zones, especially for hydrodynamic flows with complex geometry on an inhomogeneous bottom relief.","2023-06","2024-12-01 00:01:09","2024-12-01 00:01:09","","261-272","","2","56","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: PLEIADES HOUSE, 7 W 54 ST, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES Publisher: PLEIADES PUBLISHING INC Type: Article","","C:\Users\johan\Zotero\storage\Z2J7PILW\Khrapov - 2023 - Numerical Modeling of Hydrodynamic Accidents Erosion of Dams and Flooding of Territories.pdf","","parallel computing; shallow water; computational fluid dynamics; CSPH-TVD method; CUDA algorithm; dam washout and erosion; flood zones; mathematical modeling; Saint-Venant and Exner equations; tailing dump; traction sediment","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Especially in the context of climate change, these defense structures are more prone to extreme hydraulic loadings. Inundation hazard and risk map inherently depend on the dominant form of failure progression. Breaching of earthen dams or embankments is a complex phenomenon that relies on various characteristics such as constituted soil, hydraulic load, regular maintenance, etc.In the frame of the 6th workshop on River and Sedimentation Hydrodynamics and Morphodynamics, a blind benchmark test concerning progressive dam failure due to overtopping was offered to modelers in order to evaluate and calibrate their models. The present paper only reports about the simulations done at UCLouvain, during the blind phase of the benchmark test. Two depth-averaged finite-volume models were applied to this benchmark test. While the first model (WCM) decoupled the shallow-water equations from Exner's one, leaving only weak links between the different operators, the second one (CM) solved them altogether. The WCM was able to reproduce most of the reservoir's water level evolution and is hence supposed to rather accurately predict the evolution of the breach width. Conversely, the CM led to faster erosion of the dam than expected, which led to a rapid decrease of the reservoir's water level. Meanwhile, a bank-failure operator is necessary to reproduce properly the widening of the breach. Three sediment transport formulas are used to observe their influence on the erosion rate of the embankment.","2022","2024-12-01 00:01:09","2024-12-01 00:01:09","","4292-4301","","","","","","","","","","","IAHR-INT ASSOC HYDRO-ENVIRONMENT ENGINEERING RESEARCH","PASEO BAJO VIRGEN DEL PUERTO 3, MADRID, 28005, SPAIN","English","","","","","","","Backup Publisher: Univ Granada; Minist Ecol Transit & Demog Challenge, Gen Directorate Coast & Sea; Minist Ecol Transit & Demog Challenge, Gen Directorate Water; China Inst Water Resources & Hydropower Res; Int Assoc Hydro Environm Engn & Res Type: Proceedings Paper","","","","overtopping; finite-volumes; breaching; dam-failure; Embankment dam","","Ortega-Sanchez, M","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The pioneering study by Reynolds [1] showed that the standard Saint-Venant-Exner equations are unconditionally stable at subcritical Froude number. Hence, the use of depth averaged flow equations, which are commonly used by the hydraulic community, prevents the formation of bedforms as dunes. Recently, Ca (n) over tilde ada-Pereira & Bohorquez [2] have proposed a simple sediment transport formulation able to capture the formation of dune when coupled with the Saint-Venant equations. We replace the standard Exner equation with a non-equilibrium sediment transport equation that includes the following necessary ingredients: first, a phase shift in the particle entrainment rate; second, a particle diffusivity and an eddy viscosity. Subsequently, we solve the linear stability problem of an erodible-bed channel and show that the neutral curve properly captures the bed instability both in subcritical regime (i.e. dune) and supercritical flow (i.e. antidune and roll wave).

Several negative aspects related to the lack of sediment supply were observed downstream many dams and the artificial replenishment of sediment was applied as a method to restore natural morphological conditions. The replenishment technique may be seen as a pulse of sediments added to the channel. Once the pulse-like volume of sediments is added into the reach, it is seen like an alteration of the channel geometry producing cross section narrowing and flow acceleration lengthwise the river. The river geometry modification together with the water flow allow erosion and transportation of the replenished material. In this work, the response of the flow to the material added in the channel is studied by means of the 2D shallow water equations model in combination with the Exner equation for the sediment continuity equation. Computational outcomes are compared with experimental data obtained from several replenishment configurations studied in the laboratory.

The first part is devoted to the derivation of several avalanche models of Savage-Hutter type, using a depth-averaging procedure of the 3D momentum and mass equations. First, the Savage-Hutter model for aerial avalanches is presented. Two other models for partially fluidized avalanches are then described: one in which the velocities of both the fluid and the solid phases are assumed to be equal, and another one in which both velocities are unknowns of the system. Finally, a Savage-Hutter model for submarine avalanches is derived. The second part is devoted to non-newtonian models, namely viscoplastic fluids. Indeed, a one-phase viscoplastic model can also be used to simulate fluidized avalanches. A brief introduction to Rheology and plasticity is presented in order to explain the Herschel-Bulkley constitutive law. We finally present the derivation of a shallow Herschel-Bulkley model.","2014","2024-12-01 00:01:09","2024-12-01 00:01:09","","51-106","","","3","","","","SEMA SIMAI Springer Series","","","","SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG","GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND","English","","","","","","","Backup Publisher: SEMA; SMAI; Univ Malaga; French Embassy Spain; Spanish Minist Econ & Competitiveness ISSN: 2199-3041 Type: Proceedings Paper","","C:\Users\johan\Zotero\storage\8NC6LLXG\Fernandez-Nieto and Vigneaux - 2014 - Some Remarks on Avalanches Modelling An Introduction to Shallow Flows Models.pdf","","","","Pares, C; Vazquez, C; Coquel, F","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

M.","Hydro-morphologic modelling for different calamitous scenarios in a mountain stream","RIVER FLOW 2014","978-1-4987-0442-7 978-1-138-02674-2","","","","Analysis of different scenarios is addressed for the Mallero river, a mountain stream in northern Italy. A town (Sondrio) is present at the downstream end of the river. Flood hazard for Sondrio can be related either to flood events with significant sediment transport (because the in-town reach is a preferential location for aggradation processes with resulting increase of the water elevation) or to dambreak events (in case of collapse of a major landslide at relatively short distance upstream). Therefore, the manuscript explores the use of hydro-morphologic modelling to assess the level of hazard related with the scenarios for flood with intense sediment transport and for landslide and following dam-break wave. For the first scenario, a past event (flood of 1987) is considered, that has been already object of previous investigations. Propagation of the flood wave and resulting river morphologic changes are modelled using the coupled Saint-Venant and Exner equations. For the second scenario, different models are combined in an integrated process chain: available estimations of the landslide volume and models for dam breaching are used to create inflow conditions in terms of water and sediment discharge into the river, then the wave propagation is modelled again using the shallow-water, one-dimensional approach. For both scenarios, the analysis is devoted to assessing if these waves could be able to transport a significant amount of sediments to Sondrio, maximum elevation of the water surface and characterization of the time scales for the events. The role of analyses such as that presented here for territorial management and protection is discussed.","2014","2024-12-01 00:01:09","2024-12-01 00:01:09","","1603-1610","","","","","","","","","","","CRC PRESS-TAYLOR & FRANCIS GROUP","6000 BROKEN SOUND PARKWAY NW, STE 300, BOCA RATON, FL 33487-2742 USA","English","","","","","","","Backup Publisher: Swiss Fed Off Environm; BG Consulting Engineers; Hydro Exploitat SA; E dric ch; IM & IUB Engn; Basler & Hofmann; AquaVis Engn; Met Flow SA; Int Assoc Hydro Environm Engn & Res, Comm Fluvial Hydraul; Stucky; Groupe E; Patscheider Partner; HydroCosmos SA; Kissling Zbinden AG; Ribi SA; Poyry; Swiss Assoc Water Management; Ecole Polytechnique Federale Lausanne, Lab Hydraul Construct Type: Proceedings Paper","","","","","","Schleiss, AJ; DeCesare, G; Franca, MJ; Pfister, M","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The method employs an established augmented Riemann solver to compute unsteady, two-dimensional flows over arbitrary topography. An Exner equation is used to model the evolution of the bed using several common load formulas. The morphodynamic coupling is stabilized using an upwind approach. The scheme is implemented in a highly scalable block-structured adaptive mesh refinement framework. The resulting solver is well balanced and resolves the dry state while maintaining nonnegative depth. Idealized tests include comparison with exact Riemann solutions for dam break problems and an analytical solution for the migration of a one-dimensional sinusoidal bedform. Practical tests include the migration of a Gaussian perturbation and the evolution of flood and ebb shoals in a tidal inlet. The solver is benchmarked on a modern multiprocessor machine to quantify the scalability of the approach.","2013-05","2024-12-01 00:01:09","2024-12-01 00:01:09","","727-735","","3","29","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: 5130 NW 54TH STREET, COCONUT CREEK, FL 33073 USA Publisher: COASTAL EDUCATION & RESEARCH FOUNDATION Type: Article","","C:\Users\johan\Zotero\storage\Z8VTDEJU\Cowles - 2013 - A Block-Structured Adaptive Mesh Refinement Solver for Morphodynamic Modeling.pdf","","shallow water equations; morphodynamics; Adaptive mesh refinement; wetting-drying","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The discharge changes also affect the bedload rates and the characteristics of the transported sediment. So, laboratory experiments are developed to reproduce the reality, to understand the sediment dynamics and to calibrate the numerical model. The numerical model is constructed over a previous version of MOSSEM model (1D shallow water and Exner equation numerical model), including new modules to improve the dynamics of the sediment transport, better representation of the sediment fluxes in the streambed and to track the complete streambed stratigraphy. The numerical simulation results show a good agreement with the experimental information, indicating that the model can efficiently represent the different evolutionary processes of the sediments. Thus, the numerical model conforms a complete tool to analyze gravel bed rivers interventions.","2012","2024-12-01 00:01:09","2024-12-01 00:01:09","","545-550","","","","","","","","","","","CRC PRESS-TAYLOR & FRANCIS GROUP","6000 BROKEN SOUND PARKWAY NW, STE 300, BOCA RATON, FL 33487-2742 USA","English","","","","","","","Backup Publisher: Colegio Ingenieros Civiles Costa Rica; Int Assoc Hydro Environm Engn & Res, Comm Fluvial Hydraul Type: Proceedings Paper","","","","","","Munoz, RM","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We employ a 2-D numerical model based on the solution of the classical shallow water equations for the fluid phase coupled with the Exner equation and some semi empirical closure for the sediment transport rates. The model is applied to the case of a straight rectangular channel closed at the landward end and characterized by an initial plane bed, perturbed by randomly distributed disturbances of small amplitude. Numerical simulations have been performed for fixed values of the aspect ratio relatively close to the critical conditions of the linear theory. Preliminary results of our analysis show that bottom instability originates in the seaward part of the channel, giving rise to the formation of free alternate bars, with amplitudes decaying landward and wavelengths shorter than those predicted by the linear theory. Moreover, such features grow and migrate landward in time.","2008","2024-12-01 00:01:09","2024-12-01 00:01:09","","789-795","","","","","","","Proceedings and Monographs in Engineering Water and Earth Sciences","","","","TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD","11 NEW FETTER LANE, LONDON EC4P 4EE, ENGLAND","English","","","","","","","Backup Publisher: IAHR Type: Proceedings Paper","","","","","","DohmenJanssen, CM; Hulscher, SJMH","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
