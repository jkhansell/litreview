The Exner equation is used to model the morphological evolution of the bed, while a closure equation is needed to evaluate the rate of sediment transport. The system of Saint-Venant-Exner equations is solved in a fully coupled way using a finite-volume technique and a HLLC solver for the fluxes, with a novel wave-speed estimator adapted to the Exner equation. Wave speeds are usually derived by computing the eigenvalues of the full system, which is highly time-consuming when no analytical expression is available. In this paper, an eigenvalue analysis of the full system is conducted, leading to simple but still accurate wave-speed estimators. The new numerical scheme is then tested in three different situations: (1) a circular dam-break flow over movable bed, (2) an one-dimensional bed aggradation problem simulated on a 2D unstructured mesh and (3) the case of a dam-break flow in an erodible channel with a sudden enlargement, for which experimental measurements are available.

The flow hydrodynamics is represented by the shallow water equations, and the bed morphodynamics is represented by the Exner equation and an additional equation describing the nonequilibrium sediment transport. Sediment size distribution is represented by the median grain diameter and the standard deviation, instead of the usual modeling with multiple particle size classes. Various methods for computing bed elevation changes at a cross section due to erosion or deposition of sediment are proposed and tested, including an innovative approach that relates the spatial pattern of erosion and deposition rates to boundary shear stress distribution, which is calculated by the Merged Perpendicular Method. An explicit finite difference scheme is employed for solving the water and sediment governing equations. The pertinence of the model is examined for two hypothetical cases. The model is then tested on one set of laboratory experiments on bed degradation under steady flow, showing excellent model data fit, and indicating that incorporating a nonequilibrium sediment transport equation into the model structure is an important element in reproducing the bed degradation process. Finally, the model is applied to simulate the morphological changes taking place in the Ha! Ha! River (Quebec) after the failure of the Ha! Ha! Dyke on July 1996. Relevant results can be obtained in terms of changes in longitudinal bed profile and cross-sectional geometry as well as water levels, although some discrepancies are obtained between the simulated and surveyed cross-sectional geometries, mainly because bank failure and channel widening are not modeled.","2009-05-07","2024-11-20 00:35:49","2024-11-20 00:35:49","","","","","45","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: 2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA Publisher: AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION Type: Article","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The solution strategy relies on a full coupling of the governing equations within each time step. The resulting system of governing equations contains nonconservative products related to the longitudinal and lateral bed slopes and source terms related to friction. The full problem is solved numerically on unstructured triangular grids, simultaneously updating the principal part and adding the source terms (friction) using a splitting technique. The principal part is solved by means of a novel second-order accurate upwind-biased centred scheme of the finite volume type, while the source terms are added to the problem by solving a system of ordinary differential equations. A new algorithm for treating the wetting-and-drying is also proposed. The model is applied to well-established test problems in order to verify the accuracy of the proposed method, the robustness of the wetting-and-drying algorithm and the ability of the model in dealing with transcritical flows. Finally we test the model ability to reproduce two dimensional morphodynamic processes occurring at the scale of tens of channel widths in bedload dominated alluvial rivers with homogeneous grain size. This is achieved by comparing model outcomes with those of analytical theories and flume experiments on the same morphodynamic processes. These selected “benchmarks” include migrating free bars spontaneously developing in straight reaches, steady bars forced by abrupt river planform changes and the dynamics of channel bifurcations.

The model includes a robust hydrodynamic solver for the integration of the nonlinear shallow water equations (NSWE) and a rather flexible solver for the resolution of the Exner equation (used to evaluate the morphological evolution of the seabed). A detailed analysis is given of existing and novel procedures for the solution of the morphodynamic problem. Coupling of NSWE and Exner equations and updating of the solution is made by means of a sequential splitting scheme. The model has been validated by reproducing both analytical and numerical solutions, available in the recent literature, as well as an in-house laboratory experiment. The simulation of existing theoretical solutions has revealed the model performs well, especially in the prediction of the seabed evolution due to either bed-load or suspended-load transport forced by dam-break and swash-type events. The latter ones are seen to force both erosion and accretion despite the weak hydro-morphodynamic coupling. The comparison between solver results and experimental data is also encouraging, the solver reproducing well the main seabed features forced by irregular waves. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

The surface erosion is modelled with the Exner and sorting equations for multiple grain classes in combination with empirical bed-load transport formulas and advection-diffusion equations for suspended-load transport. Additionally, the lateral breach widening caused by gravitationally-induced slope failures is considered using a novel algorithm adapted for unstructured grids.

The 1D model considered here is a one-layer model based on the shallow-water equations, a bed update (Exner) equation, a space-lag equation for the nonequilibrium sediment transport and an empirical formula calculating the sediment transport capacity of the flow. The model incorporates a variety of sediment transport capacity formulas proposed by Meyer-Peter and Muller, Bagnold, Engelund and Hansen, Ackers and White, Smart and Jaeggi, van Rijn, Rickenmann, Cheng, Abrahams and Camenen, and Larson. We examine the performance of each formula by simulating four idealized laboratory cases on dam-break waves over sandy beds. Comparisons between numerical results and measurements show that for each case better predictions are obtained using a particular formula, but overall, formulas proposed by Meyer-Peter and Muller (with the factor 8 being replaced by 12), Smart and Jaggi, Cheng, Abrahams and Camenen, and Larson rank as the best predictors for the entire range of conditions studied here.

First we show that the Saint-Venant-Exner equations are linearly unstable in most cases for a uniform base flow down an inclined erodible bed for Shields numbers in excess of the threshold for incipient sediment motion allowing us to compute noise-induced pattern formation for Froude numbers below 2. The wavelength of the bed forms are selected naturally due to the absolute character of the bed instability and the existence of a maximum growth rate at a finite wavelength when the particle diffusivity coefficient and the water eddy viscosity are present as for Turing-like instability. A num e rical method is subsequently developed to analyze the performance of the model and theoretical results through three examples: the simulation of the fluctuations of the particle concentration using a stochastic Langevin equation, the deterministic simulation of anti-dunes formation over an erodible slope in full sediment-mobility conditions, and the computation of noise-induced pattern formation in hybrid stochasticdeterministic flows down a periodic flume. The full non-linear numerical simulations are in excellent agreement with the theoretical solutions. We conclude highlighting that the proposed depth-averaged formulation explains the developments of upstream migrating anti-dunes in straight flumes since the seminar experiments by Gilbert (1914).

In particular, the dam-break/bore-collapse initial condition of Shen & Meyer (J. Fluid Mech., vol. 16, 1963, pp. 113-125) and Peregrine & Williams (J. Fluid Mech., vol. 440, 2001, pp. 391-399) is investigated using a numerical model based on the method of characteristics. A sediment-transport formula (cubic in velocity u: Au-3) is used here; this belongs to a family of sediment-transport formulae for which Pritchard & Hogg (Coastal Engng, vol. 52, 2005, pp. 1-23) showed that net sediment transport under the Shen & Meyer (1963) bore collapse is offshore throughout the swash zone when a non-erodible bed is considered. It is found that full coupling with the beach, although still resulting in the net offshore transport of sediment throughout the swash zone, leads to a large reduction in the net offshore transport of sediment from the beach face. This is particularly true for the upper third of the swash zone. Moreover, in contradistinction to swash flows over non-erodible beds, flows over erodible beaches are unique to the bed mobility and porosity under consideration; this has very important implications for run-up predictions. The conclusion is that it is essential to consider full coupling of water and bed motions (i.e. full morphodynamics) in order to understand and predict sediment transport in the swash, regardless of other physical effects (e.g. turbulence, infiltration, pre-suspended sediment, etc.).","2010-10-25","2024-11-20 00:35:49","2024-11-20 00:35:49","","316-340","","","661","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: 32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA Publisher: CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS Type: Article","","","","sediment transport; coastal engineering; shallow-water flows","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The scheme is chosen because of its shock capturing capabilities and its relative simplicity, which allow different sediment transport formulae to be slotted in easily. A typical example of the kind of flows treated here is bore-driven wave run-up. The analogy with a dam-break on a mobile bed is used here to analyze the performance of the model. The model solves the nonlinear shallow water equations coupled with the Exner sediment balance equation for the mobile bed. Quasi-analytical solutions to this problem for different expressions for instantaneous sediment discharge formulae are used to test the performance of the scheme. Together with the existing solution for the Grass formula, a further solution is obtained for a different formula. Numerical tests were also carried out for a further formula that is an industry standard.

The main requirements are that the numerical results have to be accurate and simulation models must be fast. The present work is based on the 2D shallow water equations in combination with the 2D Exner equation. The resulting numerical model accuracy was already discussed in previous work. Regarding the speed of the computation, the Exner equation slows down the already costly 2D shallow water model as the number of variables to solve is increased and the numerical stability is more restrictive. In order to reduce the computational effort required for simulating realistic scenarios, the authors have exploited the use of Graphics Processing Units in combination with non-trivial optimization procedures. The gain in computing cost obtained with the graphic hardware is compared against single-core (sequential) and multi-core (parallel) CPU implementations in two unsteady cases.","2016","2024-11-20 00:35:49","2024-11-21 04:03:58","","275-288","","3","54","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: 2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND Publisher: TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD Type: Article","","","","2D; 2D shallow water; Finite volume; flood simulation; FVM; GPU; parallel computing; sediment transport; SWE-Exner","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A system comprising shallow water equations and Exner equation is solved, in which sediment transport rate q is either dependent only on depth averaged velocity (u), or on u and water depth (12). The results are in agreement with equivalent uncoupled results [2] in that all sediment transport formulae considered applied to the event of [1] yield net erosion in the whole of the swash. Consistent with [3], however, full coupling yields significantly less erosion for all the q = q(u) formulae compared to the equivalent uncoupled results. It is shown that differences between uncoupled and coupled approaches (for most formulae) accumulate over the course of the swash event. The main reason for the reduced net erosion is the smaller maximum inundation. It is also shown that including a dependence on h in the bed load sediment transport formula for fully coupled simulations can result in net deposition in the upper swash. Bed shear stress described by a Chezy law is further included in fully coupled simulations to examine net beach change. Much reduced maximum inundation and net offshore sediment transport are predicted both for q = q(u) and q = q(h,u). It is shown that although the net sediment flux at the base of the swash under one [1] swash event is still offshore, deposition in the middle or upper swash may be predicted when bed shear stress is included, particularly when the drag coefficient in the backwash is reduced compared to that in the uprush, consistent with some in-situ measurements. The implication is that bed shear stress must be included not just to obtain correct quantitative beach change, but also to obtain correct qualitative beach behaviour. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

By assuming that the local depth is much smaller than the length of the incoming wave, the shallow water equations are used to determine the water motion. The surf zone width is assumed to be small compared to the length of the incoming wave and hence the effect of wave breaking is included only parametrically. The time development of the cohesionless bottom is described by the Exner continuity equation and by an empirical sediment transport rate formula which relates the sediment flux to the steady currents and wave stirring. It is shown that the basic-state solution, which does not depend on the longshore coordinate, may be unstable with respect to longshore bedform perturbations, so that rhythmic topographies form. The instability process is due to a positive feedback mechanism involving the incoming wave, synchronous edge waves and the bedforms. The growth of the bottom perturbations is related to the presence of steady currents caused by the interaction of the incoming wave with synchronous edge waves which in turn are excited by the incoming wave moving over the wavy bed. For natural beaches the model predicts two maxima in the amplification rate: one is related to incoming waves of low frequency, the other to wind waves. Thus two bedforms of different wavelengths can coexist in the nearshore region with longshore spacings of a few hundred and a few tens of metres, respectively. To illustrate the potential validity of the model, its results are compared with field data. The overall agreement is fairly satisfactory.","1999-02-25","2024-11-20 00:35:49","2024-11-20 00:35:49","","271-303","","","381","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: 40 WEST 20TH STREET, NEW YORK, NY 10011-4211 USA Publisher: CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS Type: Article","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the impact of this technique on the hydraulics conditions, and resulting bed morphology, is yet to be understood. Several numerical tools have been developed during last years for modeling sediment transport and morphology evolution which can be used for this application. These models range from 1D to 3D approaches: the first being over simplistic for the simulation of such a complex geometry; the latter requires often a prohibitive computational effort. However, 2D models are computationally efficient and in these cases may already provide sufficiently accurate predictions of the morphology evolution caused by the sediment replenishment in a river. Here, the 2D shallow water equations in combination with the Exner equation are solved by means of a weak-coupled strategy. The classical friction approach considered for reproducing the bed channel roughness has been modified to take into account the morphological effect of replenishment which provokes a channel bed fining. Computational outcomes are compared with four sets of experimental data obtained from several replenishment configurations studied in the laboratory. The experiments differ in terms of placement volume and configuration. A set of analysis parameters is proposed for the experimental-numerical comparison, with particular attention to the spreading, covered surface and travel distance of placed replenishment grains. The numerical tool is reliable in reproducing the overall tendency shown by the experimental data. The effect of fining roughness is better reproduced with the approach herein proposed. However, it is also highlighted that the sediment clusters found in the experiment are not well numerically reproduced in the regions of the channel with a limited number of sediment grains.

In this paper, these equations are combined with the two-dimensional shallow water equations to describe the flow field. The resulting system of equations can be solved in two ways: (i) in a coupled way, solving flow and sediment equations simultaneously at a given time-step or (ii) in an uncoupled manner by first solving the flow field and using the magnitudes obtained at each time-step to update the channel morphology (bed and surface composition). The coupled strategy is preferable when dealing with strong and quick interactions between the flow field, the bed evolution and the different particle sizes present on the bed surface. A number of numerical difficulties at from solving the fully coupled system of equations. These problems are reduced by means of a weakly-coupled strategy to numerically estimate the wave celerities containing the information of the bed and the grain sizes present on the bed. Hence, a two-dimensional numerical scheme able to simulate in a self-stable way the unsteady morphological evolution of channels formed by cohesionless grain size mixtures is presented. The coupling technique is simplified without decreasing the number of waves involved in the numerical scheme but by simplifying their definitions. The numerical results are satisfactorily tested with synthetic cases and against experimental data. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The method is based on the floating grid-of-characteristics approach, which here is amended to take account of the more complex structure of the field of characteristics inherent in the morphodynamics (compared to those for hydro- or gas dynamics). Due to the relative simplicity of the algorithm the technique is particularly well suited to waves moving into a downstream reach that is initially dry. As with all MOC schemes the approach is also attractive because it reveals the underlying (morpho)dynamics as the solution progresses. The mathematical model considered here is based on the depth averaged non-linear shallow water equations directly coupled to a bed update (Exner) equation. Closure is obtained using a simple sediment flux relation. The technique described allows the study of fully coupled sediment transport problems and the associated hydro- and morphodynamic evolution. Numerical results are presented for the evolution of a sand dune in a tidal flow as well as the wet-dry dam-break problem on both a fixed and mobile bed. Results compare extremely well with the analytical or quasi-analytical solutions for the problems presented. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Moreover, these models are usually not well-balanced, meaning they are unable to correctly simulate quiescent flow. Here a well-balanced and flexible morphological model for the swash zone is presented. The nonlinear shallow water equations and the Exner equation are discretized by the shock-capturing finite volume method, in which the numerical flux and the bed slope source term are estimated by a well-balanced version of the SLIC (slope limited centered) scheme that does not depend on empirical sediment transport relations. The satisfaction of the well-balanced property is demonstrated through simulating quiescent coastal flow. The quantitative accuracy of the model in reproducing key parameters (i.e., the notional shoreline position, the swash depth, the flow velocity, the overtopping flow volume, the beach change depth and the sediment transport rate) is shown to be satisfactory through comparisons against analytical solutions, experimental data as well as previous numerical solutions. This work facilitates an improved modeling framework for the swash hydrodynamics and sediment transport. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

However, the resolution of the sediment continuity equation to simulate bed evolution is a complex problem which often leads to the development of numerical oscillations. To overcome this problem, addition of artificial diffusion or bathymetric filters are commonly employed methods, although these techniques can potentially over-smooth the bathymetry. This study aims to present a numerical scheme based on the Weighted Essentially Non-Oscillatory (WENO) formalism to solve the bed continuity equation on unstructured grids in a finite volume formulation. The new solution is compared against a classical method, which combines a basic node-centered finite volume method with artificial diffusion, for three idealized test cases. This comparison reveals that a higher accuracy is obtained with our new method while the addition of diffusion appears inappropriate mainly due to the arbitrary choice of the diffusion coefficient. Moreover, the increased computation time associated with the WENO-based method to solve the bed continuity equation is negligible when considering a fully-coupled simulation with tides and waves. Finally, the application of the new method to the pluri-monthly evolution of an idealized inlet subjected to tides and waves shows the development of realistic bed features (e.g. secondary flood channels, ebb-delta sandbars, or oblique sandbars at the adjacent beaches), that are smoothed or nonexistent when using additional diffusion.

The DOT path-conservative scheme is a robust upwind method based on a complete Riemann solver, but it has the drawback of requiring expensive numerical computations. Indeed, to compute the non-linear time evolution in each time step, the DOT scheme requires numerical computation of the flux matrix eigenstructure (the totality of eigenvalues and eigenvectors) several times at each cell edge. In this work, an analytical and compact formulation of the eigenstructure for the de Saint Venant-Exner (dSVE) model is introduced and tested in terms of numerical efficiency and stability. Using the original DOT and PRICE-C (a very efficient FORCE-type method) as reference methods, we present a convergence analysis (error against CPU time) to study the performance of the DOT method with our new analytical implementation of eigenstructure calculations (A-DOT). In particular, the numerical performance of the three methods is tested in three test cases: a movable bed Riemann problem with analytical solution; a problem with smooth analytical solution; a test in which the water flow is characterised by subcritical and supercritical regions. For a given target error, the A-DOT method is always the most efficient choice. Finally, two experimental data sets and different transport formulae are considered to test the A-DOT model in more practical case studies.","2018-03","2024-11-20 00:35:50","2024-11-20 00:35:50","","189-201","","","113","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND Publisher: ELSEVIER SCI LTD Type: Article","","","","DOT Riemann solver; Non-conservative system; Path-conservative scheme; PRICE-C - FORCE; SWE - Exner","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This method uses the moving least squares (MLS) function approximation to construct the shape functions and the minimizing least squares functional method to discretize the system of equations. The method can be viewed as a truly meshless method as it does not need any mesh for both field variable approximation and the construction of system matrices; it also provides the symmetric coefficient matrix. In the present work, several benchmark problems are studied and compared with the work of other researchers; the proposed method shows good accuracy, high convergence rate, and high efficiency, even for irregularly distributed nodes.
