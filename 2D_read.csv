0,The shallow water equations and their application to realistic cases,"The numerical modelling of 2D shallow flows in complex geometries involving transient flow and movable boundaries has been a challenge for researchers in recent years. There is a wide range of physical situations of environmental interest, such as flow in open channels and rivers, tsunami and flood modelling, that can be mathematically represented by first-order non-linear systems of partial differential equations, whose derivation involves an assumption of the shallow water type. Shallow water models may include more sophisticated terms when applied to cases of not pure water floods, such as mud/debris floods, produced by landslides. Mud/debris floods are unsteady flow phenomena in which the flow changes rapidly, and the properties of the moving fluid mixture include stop and go mechanisms. The present work reports on a numerical model able to solve the 2D shallow water equations even including bed load transport over erodible bed in realistic situations involving transient flow and movable flow boundaries. The novelty is that it offers accurate and stable results in realistic problems since an appropriate discretization of the governing equations is performed. Furthermore, the present work is focused on the importance of the computational cost. Usually, the main drawback is the high computational effort required for obtaining accurate numerical solutions due to the high number of cells involved in realistic cases. However, the proposed model is able to reduce computer times by orders of magnitude making 2D applications competitive and practical for operational flood prediction. Moreover our results show that high performance code development can take advantage of general purpose and inexpensive Graphical Processing Units, allowing to run almost 100 times faster than old generation codes in some cases."
3,Shallow Water Flow Simulation: From Mathematics to Reality,"Nowadays, the great power of modern computers combined with well-designed numerical models allows to develop computational models able to deal with simulations of several coupled phenomena over detailed complex topography. An efficient and properly calibrated computational model represents a useful tool to provide insight into the catchment dynamics at hydrological and geomorphological levels. In addition, it allows to develop detailed risk management and conservation plans. The challenge of finding a compromise between computational time and level of accuracy and robustness has traditionally expanded the use of simplified models (2D) rather than full three-dimensional models for flood simulation. This work presents a GPU accelerated 2D shallow-water model for the simulation of flood events over non-erodible and erodible bed in real time. In particular, an explicit first-order finite volume scheme is detailed to control the numerical instabilities that are likely to appear when used in complex topography. The model is applied to reproduce real events in a reach of the Ebro River (Spain) and the Cinca River (Spain) in order to compare the simulation results with the field data in a large domain and long flood duration allowing an analysis of the performance and speed-up achieved by different GPU devices. The high values of fit between observed and simulated results as well as the computational times achieved are encouraging to propose the use of the model as forecasting system. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024."
4,High performance computing in river modelling: A novel two-dimensional software for river hydro- And morphodynamic simulations,"The numerical modelling of river physical dynamics is of great importance for both process understanding in environmental science and decision support in engineering practice. The continuous gain in computational power and the development of novel numerical algorithms, facilitated the wide application of shallow water models for river flow simulation. Despite the technological and numerical advances, the computational effort required by two-dimensional shallow water river models can still range from days to weeks for, e.g., large-scale simulations or when morphodynamic studies are included. In this context, we developed and implemented the new version 3 of the freeware BASEMENT, a two-dimensional numerical simulation tool, adopting a flexible software framework for different target platforms such as multi-core CPUs or graphics processing units (GPUs). This allows for simulation speedup of a multiple of ten, depending on the problem at hand and the final target platform. Besides the hydrodynamic module, the new software includes a module for morphodynamics accounting for lateral bed slope and curvature effects. We demonstrate the outstanding performance of the software, its robustness and accuracy by hydro- and morphodynamic test cases. The results confirm that BASEMENT could be a useful tool to efficiently simulate complex and long-term river processes on large domains. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, London"
5,Numerical Modelling of Braided River Morphodynamics: Review and Future Challenges,"Numerical morphological modelling of braided rivers is increasingly used to explore controls on river pattern and for applied environmental management. This article reviews and presents a taxonomy of braided river morphodynamic models and discusses the challenges facing model development and use, illustrating these challenges with a case example. The taxonomy is contextualised by an initial discussion of the physical mechanisms of braiding. The taxonomy differentiates between reach-scale and catchment-scale models. Reach-scale models are usually physics-based, which are further divided based upon the mathematical approach used to solve equations (analytical or numerical) and their dimensionality (1D, 2D or 3D). Cellular automata models are one type of numerical model that replace at least some physical processes with expedient rules. A 2D physics-based approach encapsulates sufficient process complexity to provide behavioural predictions. Predictions from catchment-scale landscape evolution models have potential for providing boundary conditions. Future progress in physics-based modelling needs to address three challenges: (i) representation of flow and sediment transport; (ii) temporal and spatial scaling; and (iii) model calibration, sensitivity, uncertainty and validation. The key problem for addressing these is the dearth of laboratory or natural experiment datasets. To show that progress can be made by comparing reach-scale predictions to high-resolution observations, a case study of monitoring and modelling, conducted in the Rees River, New Zealand, is presented. Hydraulic predictions of cellular automata and shallow water equation (Delft3d) models are compared to observed inundation extent. The efficacy of high-resolution, multi-temporal morphological data for assessing 2D physics-based morphodynamic model predictions is also demonstrated. © 2016 The Author(s) Geography Compass © 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd"
6,Two-dimensional scour simulations based on coupled model of shallow water equations and sediment transport on unstructured meshes,"A two-dimensional scour model based on coupled system of shallow water equations (SWEs) and sediment transport on unstructured mesh is developed. The coupled system of hydrodynamic and morphodynamic equations is solved by finite volume method using Godunov scheme. Roe's approximate Riemann solver is used to calculate the inviscid fluxes. The use of unstructured mesh makes the model applicable to complex domains. However, it is difficult to evaluate the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the Jacobian matrix in the global coordinate. The method proposed herein to deal with this difficulty is to transform the system into the local coordinate with one of the axes in the same direction as the interface outward normal vector. In the local coordinate system, the Jacobian matrix is simplified and the eigenvalues are analyzed using asymptotic method. Regular expansion breaks down when the flow is near critical. Uniformity of the expansion is achieved by changing the scales. Rotational invariance theorem is used to relate the interfacial fluxes in the global and local coordinate systems. Special treatment of the source term on unstructured grid makes the scheme stable and physically balanced (both mass and momentum). The method proposed in this paper for the eigen-system is very efficient comparing to iterative numerical methods. Results from the test cases show good agreement with the experiments. © 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."
12,Development and application of two-dimensional numerical model on shallow water flows using finite volume method,"This present study develops a 2-D numerical scheme to simulate the velocity and depth on the actual terrain by using shallow water equations. The computational approach uses the HLL scheme as a basic building block, treats the bottom slope by lateralizing the momentum flux, then refines the scheme using the Strang splitting to deal with the frictional source term. Besides, a decoupled algorithm is also adopted to compute the aggradation and degradation of bed-level elevation by using the Manning-Strickler formula and Exner’s relationship. The main purpose is to set up the window interface of 2-D numerical model and increase the realization of engineers on these characteristics of hydraulic treatment and maintenance."
19,Semicoupled and fully coupled numerical models for morphodynamic flow simulation in river with irregular planforms,This paper introduces one dimensional (1D) as well as two dimensional (2D) numerical models to simulate the morphodynamic processes in open channel flows. The models use the shallow water equations for hydrodynamics and the Exner sediment continuity equation for bed morphology. The governing equations are solved here using the finite difference method (FDM) based Lax-Wendroff scheme. The 1D model uses the fully coupled approach. The 2D model however solves the boundary fitted governing equations of water flow and sediment transport coupled using the semicoupled approach. The numerical oscillations produced due to second order accuracy of the proposed models are removed here by adopting an efficient Total Variation Diminishing (TVD) technique. The influence of helical flow intensity and lateral bed slope are integrated in the sediment transport model for correctly simulating the morphodynamics in channel bends. The practical applicability of the developed models is evaluated by replicating five benchmark test cases of known analytical and experimental results and promising outcomes are obtained. Three widely used statistical parameters are also calculated to check the robustness of the proposed models.
21,A 2D numerical model for simulating landslide dam failure and induced morphological changes considering multi-layer and non-uniform sediments,"Landslide dams are formed by the blockage of rivers with landslides or any debris flows. Such dams are prone to failure and therefore, simu lation of their failure and induced morphological changes is of great importance for hazard mitigation. Multi-layer and non-uniform sediments are usually observed in landslide dam materials, but these are rarely considered in simulations. In this paper, a two-dimensional numerical model considering multi-layered and non-uniform sediments is proposed. The model solves the shallow water equations, the Exner equation considering the different size fractions and Hirano’s active layer equation based on a finite volume scheme in a weakly coupled approach. Twoexperimental tests are used to assess the applicability and accuracy of the model. The results show that it can well simulate the flowand morphological changes, as well as the surface coarsening and fining phenomena related to multi-layer and non-uniform sediments. The numerical results of dam failure process and morphological changes are in overall good agreement with the experiments, but the peak discharge and bed elevation tend to be underestimated when finer material is considered. Finally, the influence of sediments fractions an active layer depth on numerical results, as well as the limitations of the model are discussed."
22,A new 2D ESPH bedload sediment transport model for rapidly varied flows over mobile beds,"A 2D Eulerian meshless bedload sediment transport model is developed using smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) to simulate rapidly varied flows over mobile beds. In the developed model, we adopt a weakly coupled numerical approach to explicitly solve the governing equations, including 2D shallow water equations for fluid flow motion and the Exner equation for bed sediment movement at the same time step. A defined virtual bedload velocity in a weakly coupled approach is involved in the calculation of time step sizes. However, nonphysical virtual bedload velocities, which often occur in cases with nearly flat beds, require extremely small time step sizes. A formulation of the lower and upper bounds of information propagation speeds for an HLLC approximate Riemann solver is thus proposed to remedy the problem. Four case studies involving dam break flows in prismatic and erodible channels, knickpoint migration, dam erosion due to overtopping flow and dam-break flow in an erodible channel with an abrupt expansion are adopted to validate the developed model. In addition, to compare the performances of different particle interaction configurations under Cartesian uniform particle arrangements, four and eight interacting particles are obtained by changing the smoothing length. Against the measured results, the case of eight interacting particles shows more accurate predictions of erosion peaks along the measured cross-sections because the lateral flows are significant. The good agreement between the simulated and measured results shows that the developed 2D Eulerian SPH bedload sediment transport model with eight interacting particles is well suited for simulating complicated flow-induced bed erosion."
23,Numerical Exploration of the Morphodynamic Regime Diagram for Straight Channel River Flows,"Self-organising phenomena play a crucial role in river systems, from the catchment scale to the single morphological unit. Many studies on morphological patterns in straight channels have been conducted, but full regime diagrams in fundamental parameters (e.g. aspect ratio and mobility parameter) are not known yet.  However, determining such morphological regimes is crucial for prediction of river dynamics and consequently for a range of applications, from flood risk assessment to ecological management and restoration projects. This study employs a 2D numerical model based on spectral methods to explore these morphodynamic regimes in a straight channel, a first approximation of most existing managed rivers. The model couples the depth-averaged shallow-water and continuity equations for the flow and the Exner mass-conservation equation for the sediment. The morphological patterns arising from the simulations are explored in a wide range of parameter space, beyond the critical values for bar formation used in perturbation methods. A thorough taxonomy of planforms and their complexity is generated, resulting in a morphodynamic regime diagram for straight channel flows. Moreover, both the spatial and temporal characterisation of the solutions is carried out, and the presence of quasi-periodic and chaotic behaviour is investigated."
27,Numerical Modeling of Flow and Bed Load Transport Using Roe Method,"In the present study, the two-dimensional finite volume model of flow and bed load transport has been developed. The governing equations consist of shallow water equations and Exner equation. The Exner equation is based on the depth-averaged shallow water equations and bed load transport flow-sediment interaction parameter that acts as a calibration factor. In addition, The Grass model is employed to calculate sediment discharge. The governing equations are solved using a fully coupled method. The Roe method is selected to compute the intercell fluxes on quadrilateral networks. The Roe approximate Riemann solver is a first-order scheme. Finally the performance of the present model is evaluated. The results of the present model are compared with the exact solutions, and other available numerical results in one-dimensional and two-dimensional tests. Results show that the present model is appropriate, and capable of modeling the mobile beds."
29,Two-Dimensional Numerical Simulation of Bed-Load Transport of a Finite-Depth Sediment Layer: Applications to Channel Flushing,"Numerical modeling of bed-load transport in shallow flows, particularly oriented toward environmental flows, is an active field of research. Nevertheless, other possible applications exist. In particular, bed-load transport phenomena are relevant in urban drainage systems, including sewers. However, few applications of coupled two-dimensional (2D) shallow-water and bed-load transport models can be found, and their transfer from environmental applications?usually river and floodplain?into sewer applications requires some adaptation. Unlike to river systems, where there is a thick layer of sediment that constitutes a movable riverbed, sewer systems have thin layers of sediment that need to be removed, thus exposing a rigid, nonerodible surface. This problem requires careful numerical treatment to avoid generating errors and instability in the simulation. This paper deals with a numerical approach to tackle this issue in an efficient way that allows large-scale studies to be performed and provides empirical evidence that the proposed approach is accurate and applicable for sewage and channel-flushing problems."
32,Numerical modelling of two-dimensional morphodynamics with applications to river bars and bifurcations,"We study the numerical approximation of the two-dimensional morphodynamic model governed by the shallow water and Exner equations to simulate reach-scale two-dimensional morphodynamics of bedload-dominated alluvial rivers. The solution strategy relies on a full coupling of the governing equations within each time step. The resulting system of governing equations contains nonconservative products related to the longitudinal and lateral bed slopes and source terms related to friction. The full problem is solved numerically on unstructured triangular grids, simultaneously updating the principal part and adding the source terms (friction) using a splitting technique. The principal part is solved by means of a novel second-order accurate upwind-biased centred scheme of the finite volume type, while the source terms are added to the problem by solving a system of ordinary differential equations. A new algorithm for treating the wetting-and-drying is also proposed. The model is applied to well-established test problems in order to verify the accuracy of the proposed method, the robustness of the wetting-and-drying algorithm and the ability of the model in dealing with transcritical flows. Finally we test the model ability to reproduce two dimensional morphodynamic processes occurring at the scale of tens of channel widths in bedload dominated alluvial rivers with homogeneous grain size. This is achieved by comparing model outcomes with those of analytical theories and flume experiments on the same morphodynamic processes. These selected “benchmarks” include migrating free bars spontaneously developing in straight reaches, steady bars forced by abrupt river planform changes and the dynamics of channel bifurcations.

34,Numerical modelling of non-cohesive embankment breach with the dual-mesh approach,"The numerical model BASEMENT, based on the two-dimensional shallow-water equations, is applied to breaching processes of non-cohesive earth embankments due to overtopping. The governing equations are solved using an explicit finite-volume method combined with a Godunov-type approach. For spatial discretization, a mass-conserving dual-mesh approach with separate, unstructured meshes for hydrodynamic and sediment computations is developed allowing for accurate terrain representation. The surface erosion is modelled with the Exner and sorting equations for multiple grain classes in combination with empirical bed-load transport formulas and advection-diffusion equations for suspended-load transport. Additionally, the lateral breach widening caused by gravitationally-induced slope failures is considered using a novel algorithm adapted for unstructured grids. The model is successfully applied to two recent laboratory experiments including plane and spatial dike breaches, and a field-scale embankment breach. Detailed comparisons between measured and simulated laboratory spatial breach formations confirm the basic model assumptions."
39,An efficient GPU implementation for a faster simulation of unsteady bed-load transport,"Computational tools may help engineers in the assessment of sediment transport during the decision-making processes. The main requirements are that the numerical results have to be accurate and simulation models must be fast. The present work is based on the 2D shallow water equations in combination with the 2D Exner equation. The resulting numerical model accuracy was already discussed in previous work. Regarding the speed of the computation, the Exner equation slows down the already costly 2D shallow water model as the number of variables to solve is increased and the numerical stability is more restrictive. In order to reduce the computational effort required for simulating realistic scenarios, the authors have exploited the use of Graphics Processing Units in combination with non-trivial optimization procedures. The gain in computing cost obtained with the graphic hardware is compared against single-core (sequential) and multi-core (parallel) CPU implementations in two unsteady cases."
41,Assessment of the performance of numerical modeling in reproducing a replenishment of sediments in a water-worked channel,"The artificial replenishment of sediment is used as a method to re-establish sediment continuity downstream of a dam. However, the impact of this technique on the hydraulics conditions, and resulting bed morphology, is yet to be understood. Several numerical tools have been developed during last years for modeling sediment transport and morphology evolution which can be used for this application. These models range from 1D to 3D approaches: the first being over simplistic for the simulation of such a complex geometry; the latter requires often a prohibitive computational effort. However, 2D models are computationally efficient and in these cases may already provide sufficiently accurate predictions of the morphology evolution caused by the sediment replenishment in a river. Here, the 2D shallow water equations in combination with the Exner equation are solved by means of a weak-coupled strategy. The classical friction approach considered for reproducing the bed channel roughness has been modified to take into account the morphological effect of replenishment which provokes a channel bed fining. Computational outcomes are compared with four sets of experimental data obtained from several replenishment configurations studied in the laboratory. The experiments differ in terms of placement volume and configuration. A set of analysis parameters is proposed for the experimental-numerical comparison, with particular attention to the spreading, covered surface and travel distance of placed replenishment grains. The numerical tool is reliable in reproducing the overall tendency shown by the experimental data. The effect of fining roughness is better reproduced with the approach herein proposed. However, it is also highlighted that the sediment clusters found in the experiment are not well numerically reproduced in the regions of the channel with a limited number of sediment grains.

42,A model based on Hirano-Exner equations for two-dimensional transient flows over heterogeneous erodible beds,"In order to study the morphological evolution of river beds composed of heterogeneous material, the interaction among the different grain sizes must be taken into account. In this paper, these equations are combined with the two-dimensional shallow water equations to describe the flow field. The resulting system of equations can be solved in two ways: (i) in a coupled way, solving flow and sediment equations simultaneously at a given time-step or (ii) in an uncoupled manner by first solving the flow field and using the magnitudes obtained at each time-step to update the channel morphology (bed and surface composition). The coupled strategy is preferable when dealing with strong and quick interactions between the flow field, the bed evolution and the different particle sizes present on the bed surface. A number of numerical difficulties at from solving the fully coupled system of equations. These problems are reduced by means of a weakly-coupled strategy to numerically estimate the wave celerities containing the information of the bed and the grain sizes present on the bed. Hence, a two-dimensional numerical scheme able to simulate in a self-stable way the unsteady morphological evolution of channels formed by cohesionless grain size mixtures is presented. The coupling technique is simplified without decreasing the number of waves involved in the numerical scheme but by simplifying their definitions. The numerical results are satisfactorily tested with synthetic cases and against experimental data. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."
52,A two-dimensional finite volume solution of dam-break hydraulics over erodible sediment beds,"Two-dimensional dam-break hydraulics over erodible sediment beds are solved using a well-balanced finite volume method. The governing equations consist of three coupled model components: (i) the shallow water equations for the hydrodynamical model, (ii) a transport equation for the dispersion of suspended sediments, and (iii) an Exner equation for the morphological model. These coupled models form a hyperbolic system of conservation laws with source terms. The proposed finite volume method consists of a predictor stage for the discretization of gradient terms and a corrector stage for the treatment of source terms. The gradient fluxes are discretized using a modified Roe's scheme using the sign of the Jacobian matrix in the coupled system. A well-balanced discretization is used for the treatment of source terms. In this paper, we also describe an adaptive procedure in the finite volume method by monitoring the concentration of suspended sediments in the computational domain during its transport process. The method uses unstructured meshes, incorporates upwinded numerical fluxes and slope limiters to provide sharp resolution of steep sediment concentration and bed-load gradients that may form in the approximate solution. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2011."
60,Numerical modeling of sediment transport applied to coastal morphodynamics,"A bed-load sediment transport model is used to describe realistic cases of the morphodynamics in coastal areas. The hydrodynamic equations are based on the well-known, two-dimensional depth-averaged non-linear shallow water equations, with bathymetry forces and friction, which are subsequently coupled to the Exner equation to describe the morphological evolution. Different forms of the bed-load transport flux are considered in the Exner equation and certain relations between them are established. The numerical model is expressed in a fully-coupled form where a single system of equations is solved by a high resolution two-dimensional finite volume scheme of the relaxation type. The relaxation is performed by classical models where neither approximate Riemann solvers nor characteristic decompositions are needed. The overall numerical scheme is validated in benchmark problems, and for a realistic application of a coastal area on the northern side of the island of Crete. The validity of these results is established by comparisons made with the well-known MIKE Software by DHI Group. (C) 2014 IMACS. Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."
69,A 2D HLL-based weakly coupled model for transient flows on mobile beds,"We propose a finite-volume model that aims at improving the ability of 2D numerical models to accurately predict the morphological evolution of sandy beds when subjected to transient flows like dam-breaks. This model solves shallow water and Exner equations with a weakly coupled approach while the fluxes at the interfaces of the cells are calculated thanks to a lateralized HLLC flux scheme. Besides describing the model, we ran it for four different test cases: a steady flow on an inclined bed leading to aggradation or degradation, a dam-break leading to high interaction between the flow and the bed, a dam-break with a symmetrical enlargement close to the gate and a dam-break in a channel with a 90 degrees bend. The gathered results are discussed and compared to an existing fully coupled approach based on HLLC fluxes. Although both models equally perform regarding water levels, the weakly coupled model looks to better predict the bed evolution for the four test cases. In particular, its results are not affected by an excessive numerical diffusion encountered by the coupled model. Moreover, it usually better estimates the amplitudes of the maximum deposits and scours. It is also more stable when subject to high bed-flow interaction."
73,A Predictor-corrector scheme for simulation of two-phase granular flows over a moved bed with a variable topography,"In this paper, we propose a numerical simulation of two-phase shallow granular flows through a moved bed with a variable irregular topography via a predictor corrector scheme. This method consists of predictor and corrector stages. The predictor stage contains a parameter to control the numerical diffusion that is performed by utilizing limiters and Riemann invariant theory. The corrector stage recovers the balance conservation equation. In the first part, we solve numerically the one-dimensional equation for two-phase shallow granular flows over a fixed bed with irregular topography. In the second part, we consider the model equations for the bed-load sediment transport, the governing model equations consist of two components, specifically, a geophysical flows part and interstitial fluid. The sediment part is described by the Exner equation when the velocity can be considered to be the solid velocity, fluid velocity or a mean value of both of them.(c) 2022 Elsevier Masson SAS.

80,"An Unstructured-Grid Based Morphodynamic Model for Sandbar Simulation in the Modaomen Estuary, China","The Modaomen Estuary is the most important passageway in discharging flood and sediment of the Pearl River Delta, which is one of the most complex estuarine systems in China. Due to the coupling effect among tidal currents, waves, and sediments, an immense sandbar area evolved in the outer subaqueous delta, impeding the flood releasing during wet season, as well as salinity intrusion during the dry season. In this work, an unstructured-grid based morphodynamic model was proposed to simulate the sandbar evolution process in the Modaomen Estuary. The proposed model was constructed by using the two-dimensional shallow water equations for tidal flow, the advection-diffusion equations for salinity and suspended sediment transport, and the non-equilibrium formulation of the Exner equation for bed evolution. To simulate the wave-induced longshore currents in the Modaomen Estuary, an adaptive time-stepping approach was proposed to couple the unstructured-grid based Simulating WAves Nearshore (SWAN) model and the shallow flow model. An integrated solver is proposed for computing flow, salinity, and sediment transport fluxes simultaneously, and then the shallow water equations and advection-diffusion equations are jointly solved by a high-resolution, unstructured-grid Godunov method. Application of the model to the Modaomen Estuary, using calibrated parameter values, gives results comparable to the measured data. The butterfly shape of the sandbar in the Modaomen Estuary is considerably well simulated by the proposed model, which matches well with the measured topography."
82,Decoupled solution of the sediment transport and 2D shallow water equations using the finite volume method,"In this paper was successfully implemented a numerical solution of the sediment transport and 2D shallow water equations using the decoupled approach. Different discharge formulas to approximate the solid discharge of the sediment were used. The flow field was calculated by solving the shallow water equations and was discretized using the finite volume method; the Godunov's method along with the Roe's Riemann solver was used to approximate the numerical fluxes. The sediment transport was modeled with the Exner equation which was discretized using the Roe's scheme and the finite volume method. In addition, it was proposed an algorithm to guarantee the mass balance in the whole domain for water and sediment at all time steps. The results were compared with experimental measurements reported by other authors to validate the implemented solution."
86,A Semi-Coupled Model for Morphological Flow Simulation in River Bend,This paper presents a new efficient and robust numerical model for morphological flow simulation in river bends. The hydrodynamic model is developed by solving the two dimensional (2D) shallow water equations using a total variation diminishing (TVD) MacCormack predictor corrector scheme. The present TVD method is very simple and provides accurate results free from numerical oscillations near sharp gradient. The effective stresses are modeled by using a constant eddy viscosity model. The sediment transport model solves the Exner equation using a simple forward time and central space (FTCS) finite difference algorithm. The sediment transport model incorporates the helical flow and the transverse bed slope effects on the sediment direction computation. These models are coupled using the semicoupled approach. The present semicoupled model is used to replicate two popular experimental test cases of both tight and loose channel bends. The obtained results in terms of bed level variation reveal that the model can accurately simulate several features of the bed changes such as oscillations of the transverse bed profile with the formation of point bars and pools along the banks. The values obtained for three widely used statistical parameters show the applicability of the present model for this type of complex scenarios.
98,A SECOND-ORDER WELL-BALANCED LAGRANGE-PROJECTION NUMERICAL SCHEME FOR SHALLOW WATER EXNER EQUATIONS IN 1D AND 2D,"The present work is devoted to the numerical approximation of the shallow water Exner system in both one and two dimensions, where the Exner equation expresses the evolution in time of the bed sediment. Both the Grass and the Meyer-Peter & Mu & BULL;ller formulas are taken into account to model the solid transport discharge contributions. The numerical scheme is based on the Lagrange-projection formalism which consists in splitting the mathematical model into the acoustic and transport systems. This work is considered as a first step to understand how to include the Exner equation in this framework and, for this reason, the Exner equation is taken into account only at the transport level; both a decoupled and weakly coupled formulations are proposed. New strategies to include the Exner equation at the acoustic level or in both steps will be treated in the next work. The methods are designed in such a way to satisfy the well-balanced property as well. Details to reach the second-order of accuracy are given; numerical results are shown to validate the numerical schemes."
100,A fully-coupled bedload sediment transport model based on a two-dimensional modified wave propagation algorithm,"In this paper, an extension of a second-order Godunov-type wave propagation algorithm is presented for modelling two-dimensional morphodynamic problems using a coupled approach. In this solution, the two-dimensional shallow water equations (SWEs) and bedload sediment mass balance laws are expressed in a coupled form. The proposed numerical solver treats the source term including the bedload variations as well as the friction terms within the flux-differencing of the finite-volume neighbouring cells. In order to solve the morphodynamic system in two-dimensions, the dimensional-splitting method is utilized. To consider the bedload sediment discharge within the Exner equation, the Smart and Meyer-Peter & Muller formulae are adopted. To verify the capability of the extended wave propagation solver in dealing with different flow regimes several numerical test cases are investigated. The numerical results show that for all examined cases, excellent agreement is achieved between the numerical results and the exact solutions and experimental data, confirming the effectiveness of the method."
126,A Block-Structured Adaptive Mesh Refinement Solver for Morphodynamic Modeling,"An adaptive solver for two-dimensional horizontal morphodynamic modeling studies is presented. The method employs an established augmented Riemann solver to compute unsteady, two-dimensional flows over arbitrary topography. An Exner equation is used to model the evolution of the bed using several common load formulas. The morphodynamic coupling is stabilized using an upwind approach. The scheme is implemented in a highly scalable block-structured adaptive mesh refinement framework. The resulting solver is well balanced and resolves the dry state while maintaining nonnegative depth. Idealized tests include comparison with exact Riemann solutions for dam break problems and an analytical solution for the migration of a one-dimensional sinusoidal bedform. Practical tests include the migration of a Gaussian perturbation and the evolution of flood and ebb shoals in a tidal inlet. The solver is benchmarked on a modern multiprocessor machine to quantify the scalability of the approach."
128,Numerical discretization of the Exner equation in unsteady floods,"Two dimensional transient flow over erodible bed is solved using the 2D shallow-water equations including the Exner equation to describe morphological evolution. The numerical scheme uses a finite-volume technique and an augmented Roe solver that provides a set of four waves derived from an approximate Jacobian matrix constructed by fully coupling all the equations. The numerical scheme allows to include different closure equations needed to evaluate the rate of sediment transport. The generalized scheme was validated in previous work with exact solutions and experimental data. In this work the relative performance of Meyer-Peter and Muller, Ashida and Michue, Engelund and Fredsoe, Fernandez Luque and Van Beek, Parker, Smart, Nielsen, Wong and Camenen and Larson formulations is compared."
130,On the formation and migration of free bars in finite tidal channels,"This contribution investigates the formation and migration of free bars in tidal channels of finite length. We employ a 2-D numerical model based on the solution of the classical shallow water equations for the fluid phase coupled with the Exner equation and some semi empirical closure for the sediment transport rates. The model is applied to the case of a straight rectangular channel closed at the landward end and characterized by an initial plane bed, perturbed by randomly distributed disturbances of small amplitude. Numerical simulations have been performed for fixed values of the aspect ratio relatively close to the critical conditions of the linear theory. Preliminary results of our analysis show that bottom instability originates in the seaward part of the channel, giving rise to the formation of free alternate bars, with amplitudes decaying landward and wavelengths shorter than those predicted by the linear theory. Moreover, such features grow and migrate landward in time."
135,Optimal Control of Sediment in Irrigation Canals,"In this work a 2D mathematical model for simulating the sedimentation of suspended particles in canals is proposed. This model is obtained by coupling the shallow water equations for hydrodynamics with the Exner equations for sediment transport. Looking to avoid the suspended particles settling and their unwanted effects, the model is used to formulate the problem of the management of an irrigation canal, as an optimal control problem (OCP) of partial differential equations. The OCP is solved by interfacing MIKE21 package for modelling stage, with the authors' own MATLAB code for optimizing purpose. Finally, some numerical results are presented for a realistic case."
140,An unstructured finite-volume method for coupled models of suspended sediment and bed load transport in shallow-water flows,"The aim of this work is to develop a well-balanced finite-volume method for the accurate numerical solution of the equations governing suspended sediment and bed load transport in two-dimensional shallow-water flows. The modelling system consists of three coupled model components: (i) the shallow-water equations for the hydrodynamical model; (ii) a transport equation for the dispersion of suspended sediments; and (iii) an Exner equation for the morphodynamics. These coupled models form a hyperbolic system of conservation laws with source terms. The proposed finite-volume method consists of a predictor stage for the discretization of gradient terms and a corrector stage for the treatment of source terms. The gradient fluxes are discretized using a modified Roe's scheme using the sign of the Jacobian matrix in the coupled system. A well-balanced discretization is used for the treatment of source terms. In this paper, we also employ an adaptive procedure in the finite-volume method by monitoring the concentration of suspended sediments in the computational domain during its transport process. The method uses unstructured meshes and incorporates upwinded numerical fluxes and slope limiters to provide sharp resolution of steep sediment concentrations and bed load gradients that may form in the approximate solutions. Details are given on the implementation of the method, and numerical results are presented for two idealized test cases, which demonstrate the accuracy and robustness of the method and its applicability in predicting dam-break flows over erodible sediment beds. The method is also applied to a sediment transport problem in the Nador lagoon. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."
141,Finite volumes for 2D shallow-water flow with bed-load transport on unstructured grids,"In this work, two-dimensional (2D) bed-load transport simulations based on the depth-averaged shallow-water equations and the Exner equation are presented. The Exner equation is written assuming that bed-load transport is governed by a power law of the depth-averaged flow velocity and by a flow/sediment interaction parameter acting as a calibration coefficient. Uncoupled and coupled numerical resolutions of the global problem are considered. A Roe-type first-order upwind scheme has been applied as approximate Riemann solver for the discretization on 2D unstructured meshes. The uncoupled resolution is presented as a simple extension of a previous 2D shallow-water model. The details of the new implementation in the coupled system problem are provided. The models are tested comparing with exact solutions of 2D cases as well as experimental laboratory data. Copyright © 2012 International Association for Hydro-Environment Engineering and Research."
142,Implicit time advancing combined with two finite-volume methods in the simulation of morphodynamic flows,"Numerical simulation of morphodynamic problems is considered. The physical model is based on the shallow-water equations coupled with the Exner equation closed by the Grass model to describe the time evolution of the bed profile. The SRNH predictor-corrector scheme and a modified Roe scheme for non-conservative systems of equations are considered for space discretization. Second-order accuracy in space is achieved through variable reconstruction. These schemes were previously used in the simulation of the considered problems together with explicit time advancing. Linearized implicit time-advancing versions are generated here, in which the flux Jacobians are computed through automatic differentiation. Second-order accuracy in time is obtained through a backward differentiation formula associated with a defect-correction approach. For both the considered numerical methods, the explicit and implicit versions are compared in terms of accuracy and efficiency for one-dimensional and two-dimensional morphodynamic problems characterized by different time scales for the evolution of the bed and of the water flow. © 2013 IMACS.

143,"A coupled two-dimensional numerical model for rapidly varying flow, sediment transport and bed morphology","This paper presents a coupled two-dimensional model that can produce a more stable numerical simulation of rapid bed evolution than the conventional decoupled model. To solve the coupled bed-load sediment transport terms using a Godunov-type central-upwind method, a novel scheme to estimate the bed-load fluxes which can produce more accurate results than the previously reported coupled model is proposed using a pair of local wave speeds different from those used for the flow. The two-dimensional shallow water equations are used to solve the flow velocities and water depth. The bed level is solved by an Exner-based equation containing bed-load sediment transport as numerical flux terms and sediment entrainment and deposition as source terms. Analytical formulas to compute the eigenvalues of the Jacobian matrix are developed. The linear reconstruction of variables with a multi-dimensional slope limiter, and the second-order Runge-Kutta scheme are employed to achieve higher accuracy in space and time. For the case of rapid bed-erosion, the accuracy and stability of the proposed coupled model are verified by several numerical tests. © 2015 International Association for Hydro-Environment Engineering and Research."
145,Comparison of new efficient 2D models for the simulation of bedload transport using the augmented Roe approach,"The bedload transport system of equations, composed by the two-dimensional shallow water equations for the free surface flow motion and the 2D Exner or bedload transport equation for the erodible bed layer, is used for a wide range of sediment transport processes in environmental surface flows. In this work, the numerical resolution has been implemented using improved and efficient versions of two different strategies for combining the hydrodynamical and morphodynamical components of the system. The first strategy is based on the full coupling of the flow and bedload transport equations (FCM), leading to a new formulation for the intercell numerical fluxes which includes the bed elevation into the resolution of the approximated local Riemann problem (RP) at the edges. The stability region of this method is controlled by the eigenvalues of the coupled Jacobian matrix at each intercell edge. On the second hand, an alternative decoupled strategy is considered based on solving independently the shallow water and the bed transport equations at each time step but controlling the stability region by means of an approximation of the coupled Jacobian matrix eigenvalues. This method, called approximate-coupled (ACM) allows simpler expressions for the numerical fluxes at the edges and ensures the stability of the scheme. Both strategies are based on the Finite Volume (FV) method using Roe's approach for the computation of the numerical fluxes between neighbouring cells and have been implemented into the same CPU-based numerical kernel in order to perform a realistic comparison of the range of applicability and computational efficiency. The ACM can only guarantee non-oscillatory results when the bed-flow interaction factor is small G≤O(10−3). If the interaction factor G is medium or high, G>O(10−2), the decoupled scheme loses its accuracy and robustness. Furthermore, for highly erosive flows the FCM scheme demonstrates to be more efficient in terms of computational effort than the ACM, one of the key points for large-scale and long-term bedload transport realistic applications. © 2021 The Author(s)"
147,Two-dimensional numerical modelling of shallow water flows over multilayer movable beds,"The two-dimensional modelling of shallow water flows over multi-sediment erodible beds is presented. A novel approach is developed for the treatment of multiple sediment types in morphodynamics. The governing equations include the two-dimensional shallow water equations for hydrodynamics, an Exner-type equation for morphodynamics, a two-dimensional transport equation for the suspended sediments, and a set of empirical equations for entrainment and deposition. Multilayer sedimentary beds are formed of different erodible soils with sediment properties and new exchange conditions between the bed layers are developed for the model. The coupled equations yield a hyperbolic system of balance laws with source terms. As a numerical solver for the system, we implement a fast finite volume characteristics method. The numerical fluxes are reconstructed using the method of characteristics which employs projection techniques. The proposed finite volume solver is simple to implement, satisfies the conservation property and can be used for two-dimensional sediment transport problems in non-homogeneous isotropic beds without need of complicated three-dimensional equations. To assess the performance of the proposed models, we present numerical results for a wide variety of shallow water flows over sedimentary layers. Comparisons to experimental data for dam-break problems over movable beds are also included in this study. © 2020 Elsevier Inc."
149,Well-balanced central-upwind scheme for a fully coupled shallow water system modeling flows over erodible bed,"Intense sediment transport and rapid bed evolution are frequently observed under highly-energetic flows, and bed erosion sometimes is of the same magnitude as the flow itself. Simultaneous simulation of multiple physical processes requires a fully coupled system to achieve an accurate hydraulic and morphodynamical prediction. In this paper, we develop a high-order well-balanced finite-volume method for a new fully coupled two-dimensional hyperbolic system consisting of the shallow water equations with friction terms coupled with the equations modeling the sediment transport and bed evolution.The nonequilibrium sediment transport equation is used to predict the sediment concentration variation. Since bed-load, sediment entrainment and deposition have significant effects on the bed evolution, an Exner-based equation is adopted together with the Grass bed-load formula and sediment entrainment and deposition models to calculate the morphological process. The resulting 5. ×. 5 hyperbolic system of balance laws is numerically solved using a Godunov-type central-upwind scheme on a triangular grid. A computationally expensive process of finding all of the eigenvalues of the Jacobian matrices is avoided: The upper/lower bounds on the largest/smallest local speeds of propagation are estimated using the Lagrange theorem. A special discretization of the bed-slope term is proposed to guarantee the well-balanced property of the designed scheme. The proposed fully coupled model is verified on a number of numerical experiments. © 2015 Elsevier Inc."
155,Linearized implicit time advancing and defect correction applied to sediment transport simulations,"The numerical simulation of sediment transport problems is considered in this paper. The physical problem is modeled through the shallow-water equations coupled with the Exner equation to describe the time evolution of the bed profile. The spatial discretization of the governing equations is carried out by a finite-volume method and a modified Roe scheme designed for non-conservative systems. As for the time advancing, starting from an explicit method, a linearized implicit scheme is generated, in which the flux Jacobian is computed through automatic differentiation. Second-order accuracy in space is then obtained through MUSCL reconstruction and in time through a backward differentiation formula associated with a defect-correction approach. The implicit time advancing is compared in terms of accuracy and computational time with the explicit approach for one-dimensional and two-dimensional sediment transport problems, characterized by different time scales for the evolution of the bed and of the water flow. It is shown that, whenever the use of large time steps is compatible with the capture of the water flow dynamics and of the bedload evolution, the implicit scheme is far more efficient than its explicit counterpart with a CPU reduction up to more than two orders of magnitude. This makes implicit time differencing an attractive option for complex real life applications in this area. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd."
156,Coupled dam-break flow and bed load modelling using HLLC-WAF scheme,"A two-dimensional numerical model predicting flow over a mobile bed has been developed. Governing equations consist of the shallow water equations and the Exner equation. The finite volume method on an unstructured triangular grid was deployed to discretize the governing equations. The local Riemann problem is solved by the Harten, Lax and van Leer-contact (HLLC) method in the interface of the cells and the equations are solved using a fully coupled method. Then the flux modelling has been deployed by the total variation diminishing (TVD) version of the weighted average flux (WAF) scheme. The model was verified by comparison of the results and available experimental data for dam-break flow, in a laboratory test, via a channel with sudden enlargement and erodible bed conditions. Comparison of these two sets of results shows that increasing the accuracy of flux modelling caused the model results to have a reasonable agreement with the experimental data. © 2015 IWA Publishing."
160,Fully coupled methods for multiphase morphodynamics,"We present numerical methods for a system of equations consisting of the two dimensional Saint-Venant shallow water equations (SWEs) fully coupled to a completely generalized Exner formulation of hydrodynamically driven sediment discharge. This formulation is implemented by way of a discontinuous Galerkin (DG) finite element method, using a Roe Flux for the advective components and the unified form for the dissipative components. We implement a number of Runge-Kutta time integrators, including a family of strong stability preserving (SSP) schemes, and Runge-Kutta Chebyshev (RKC) methods. A brief discussion is provided regarding implementational details for generalizable computer algebra tokenization using arbitrary algebraic fluxes. We then run numerical experiments to show standard convergence rates, and discuss important mathematical and numerical nuances that arise due to prominent features in the coupled system, such as the emergence of nondifferentiable and sharp zero crossing functions, radii of convergence in manufactured solutions, and nonconservative product (NCP) formalisms. Finally we present a challenging application model concerning hydrothermal venting across metalliferous muds in the presence of chemical reactions occurring in low pH environments. © 2013."
161,Numerical assessment of bed-load discharge formulations for transient flow in 1D and 2D situations,"Two-dimensional (2D) transient flow over an erodible bed can be modelled using shallow-water equations and the Exner equation to describe the morphological evolution of the bed. Considering the fact that well-proven capacity formulae are based on one-dimensional (1D) experimental steady flows, the assessment of these empirical relations under unsteady 1D and 2D situations is important. In order to ensure the reliability of the numerical experimentation, the formulation has to be general enough to allow the use of different empirical laws. Moreover, the numerical scheme must handle correctly the coupling between the 2D shallow-water equations and the Exner equation under any condition. In this work, a finite-volume numerical scheme that includes these two main features will be exploited here in 1D and 2D laboratory test cases. The relative performances of Meyer-Peter and Müller, Ashida and Michiue, Engelund and Fredsoe, Fernandez Luque and Van Beek, Parker, Smart, Nielsen, Wong and Camenen and Larson formulations are analysed in terms of the root mean square error. A new discretization of the Smart formula is provided, leading to promising predictions of the erosion/deposition rates. The results arising from this work are useful to justify the use of an empirical sediment bed-load discharge formula among the ones studied, regardless of the hydrodynamic situation. © IWA Publishing 2013."
162,Numerical Simulation of Sediment Transport in Unsteady Open Channel Flow,"This paper presented a two-dimensional, well-balanced hydrodynamic and sediment transport model based on the solutions of variable-density shallow-water equations (VDSWEs) and the Exner equation for bed change for simulating sediment transport in unsteady flows. Those equations are solved in a coupled way by the first-order Godunov-type finite volume method. The Harten–Lax–van Leer–Contact (HLLC) Riemann solver is extended to find the local Riemann fluxes to maintain the exact balance between the momentum term and the bed slope term. A well-balanced scheme is superior to an unbalanced scheme to minimize numerical dispersion as demonstrated by the synthetic standing contact-discontinuity test case. Following this, the model is employed to simulate two laboratory experiments and a field case, the 1996 Lake Ha! Ha! flood event in Canada. The results of water surface elevations and bed surface profiles agree well with the measurements. The accuracy and robustness of the numerical schemes make the model a good candidate for practical engineering applications. © 2023 by the authors."
167,Integration of a Levee Breach Erosion Model in a GPU-Accelerated 2D Shallow Water Equations Code,"This paper presents a two-dimensional shallow water equations code coupled with a physically based erosion model, able to predict the opening and evolution of breaches forming in levees built with either cohesive or noncohesive material. The bottom elevation change is evaluated using an excess shear-stress equation, which accounts for the hydrodynamic conditions and for the material characteristics. The proposed model modifies the local topography at runtime wherever the levee is overtopped without having to predefine the position and shape of the breach. The model is implemented in CUDA programming language, so that simulations can be run on graphics processing units, guaranteeing fast execution times even for high-resolution meshes and large domains. The validation is performed based on several experimental tests, and numerical predictions are in good agreement with the measurements. The strengths and weaknesses of the proposed approach are also discussed by comparison with a sediment transport model based on the Exner equation: While the latter gives good results only for breaches forming in levees built with noncohesive material, the proposed model can also be applied to cohesive embankments. The application to a historical flood event is also presented, showing that the model can effectively be employed for real field simulations also in the case of multiple breaches."
