There is a wide range of physical situations of environmental interest, such as flow in open channels and rivers, tsunami and flood modelling, that can be mathematically represented by first-order non-linear systems of partial differential equations, whose derivation involves an assumption of the shallow water type. Shallow water models may include more sophisticated terms when applied to cases of not pure water floods, such as mud/debris floods, produced by landslides. Mud/debris floods are unsteady flow phenomena in which the flow changes rapidly, and the properties of the moving fluid mixture include stop and go mechanisms. The present work reports on a numerical model able to solve the 2D shallow water equations even including bed load transport over erodible bed in realistic situations involving transient flow and movable flow boundaries. The novelty is that it offers accurate and stable results in realistic problems since an appropriate discretization of the governing equations is performed. Furthermore, the present work is focused on the importance of the computational cost. Usually, the main drawback is the high computational effort required for obtaining accurate numerical solutions due to the high number of cells involved in realistic cases. However, the proposed model is able to reduce computer times by orders of magnitude making 2D applications competitive and practical for operational flood prediction. Moreover our results show that high performance code development can take advantage of general purpose and inexpensive Graphical Processing Units, allowing to run almost 100 times faster than old generation codes in some cases.",2019,2024-11-15 19:42:33,2024-12-01 00:36:00,,1235–1252,,,19,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Publisher: Springer,,C:\Users\johan\Zotero\storage\J3TCMUYG\García-Navarro et al. - 2019 - The shallow water equations and their application to realistic cases.pdf,,Finite volumes; SWE-Exner; GPU; HPC; 2D; Validation Methods; Numerical Method; Unsteady shallow flows; Wetting/drying fronts; River flows,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Google-Scholar,Theshallowwaterequationsandtheirapplicationtorealisticcases,[0.9316492676734924],[0.9355234503746033],[0.9992175698280334],[0.28907057642936707],[0.7892336845397949],[0.6886777877807617],[0.9989433288574219],[0.016737205907702446],[0.11591067165136337],[0.018653521314263344],[0.6908720135688782],[0.06638737767934799]

In the first part, we analyze the mathematical properties and the applications of the staggered grid scheme. The robustness of this scheme is validated on various applications such as the rotating shallow water equations for geostrophic flows model and viscous shallow water equations. In the second part, we consider some related models. Firstly focusing on the coupling between the Exner equation and the shallow water equations, modelling bedload sediment transport, we observe in a particular case the numerical convergence of the scheme to the exact solution, as well as a good agreement with the experimental data in the dam-break with erodible bottom test. Secondly, we present a numerical scheme based on the finite volume collocated scheme (HLLC) in order to approximate the Richard-Gavrilyuk model.

There is a wide range of physical situations in which these shallow-type formulations are applicable, such as open channels and rivers, tsunamis, floods, landslides or muddy slurries. Their numerical solution on the finite volume framework is governed by the dynamical properties of the flow, the uneven distribution of the bed level and also by the computational grid choice. The unified discretization of spatial flux derivatives and source terms has proven useful to ensure the properties of monotonicity, stability and conservation in the numerical solution. Surface shallow flows that occur in catchments and coasts usually require large space resolution over longer periods of time. The increasing complexity of the mathematical models, the advancements in numerical methods, as well as the increasing power of computation are making possible the physically-based simulation of these phenomena. The necessity of spatial resolution involves the use of a large number of elements, which increases the computational time when simulating realistic scenarios for a long time period. The resulting approach from the proper mathematical formulation, robust numerical resolution and efficient computational implementation of models (EST) can be very useful in the simulation of environmental surface processes with realistic temporal and spatial scales.",2022,2024-11-15 19:42:34,2024-11-24 04:24:49,,67–137,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Recommendations,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Google-Scholar,FinitevolumemodelsandefficientsimulationtoolsESTforshallowflows,[0.04476431384682655],[0.6226027607917786],[0.34037551283836365],[0.8384153246879578],[0.22312304377555847],[0.035948317497968674],[0.6682851910591125],[0.061989448964595795],[0.06103112921118736],[0.03843008726835251],[0.003069387748837471],[0.06136776879429817]

An efficient and properly calibrated computational model represents a useful tool to provide insight into the catchment dynamics at hydrological and geomorphological levels. In addition, it allows to develop detailed risk management and conservation plans. The challenge of finding a compromise between computational time and level of accuracy and robustness has traditionally expanded the use of simplified models (2D) rather than full three-dimensional models for flood simulation. This work presents a GPU accelerated 2D shallow-water model for the simulation of flood events over non-erodible and erodible bed in real time. In particular, an explicit first-order finite volume scheme is detailed to control the numerical instabilities that are likely to appear when used in complex topography. The model is applied to reproduce real events in a reach of the Ebro River (Spain) and the Cinca River (Spain) in order to compare the simulation results with the field data in a large domain and long flood duration allowing an analysis of the performance and speed-up achieved by different GPU devices. The high values of fit between observed and simulated results as well as the computational times achieved are encouraging to propose the use of the model as forecasting system. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.",2024,2024-11-21 20:41:52,2024-12-01 00:37:45,,151-166,,,Part F2923,,,,,,,,,,English,,,,,,,Publisher: Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH,,,,SWE-Exner; GPU; 2D; CUDA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Google-Scholar,ShallowWaterFlowSimulationFromMathematicstoReality,[0.16742275655269623],[0.9974291324615479],[0.9967077374458313],[0.9226218461990356],[0.5018806457519531],[0.03517797961831093],[0.9972476959228516],[0.26497605443000793],[0.049085188657045364],[0.007093861699104309],[0.021004365757107735],[0.8455602526664734]

The continuous gain in computational power and the development of novel numerical algorithms, facilitated the wide application of shallow water models for river flow simulation. Despite the technological and numerical advances, the computational effort required by two-dimensional shallow water river models can still range from days to weeks for, e.g., large-scale simulations or when morphodynamic studies are included. In this context, we developed and implemented the new version 3 of the freeware BASEMENT, a two-dimensional numerical simulation tool, adopting a flexible software framework for different target platforms such as multi-core CPUs or graphics processing units (GPUs). This allows for simulation speedup of a multiple of ten, depending on the problem at hand and the final target platform. Besides the hydrodynamic module, the new software includes a module for morphodynamics accounting for lateral bed slope and curvature effects. We demonstrate the outstanding performance of the software, its robustness and accuracy by hydro- and morphodynamic test cases. The results confirm that BASEMENT could be a useful tool to efficiently simulate complex and long-term river processes on large domains. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, London",2020,2024-11-21 20:41:53,2024-12-01 00:39:50,,1401-1408,,,,,,,,,,,CRC Press/Balkema,,English,,,,,,,,,C:\Users\johan\Zotero\storage\EQWAEPPM\Vetsch et al. - 2020 - High performance computing in river modelling A novel two-dimensional software for river hydro-and.pdf,,Numerical models; OpenMP; SWE-Exner; GPU; HPC; CUDA; Morphodynamics; Computer graphics; Graphics processing unit; Program processors; Buildings; Computer programming; Decision support systems; Decision supports; Engineering practices; Environmental decisions; Environmental science; Performance computing; Physical dynamics; Process understanding; River model; Rivers; Simulation platform; Software testing; Two-dimensional,,"Uijttewaal W., Crosato A., Franca M.J., Valero D., Chavarrias V., Arbos C.Y., Schielen R., Schielen R.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Google-Scholar,HighperformancecomputinginrivermodellingAnoveltwodimensionalsoftwareforriverhydroAndmorphodynamicsimulations,[0.1588256061077118],[0.7376309633255005],[0.9972797632217407],[0.4742164611816406],[0.7328787446022034],[0.3815363645553589],[0.9991065859794617],[0.013070785440504551],[0.07835980504751205],[0.0008009535376913846],[0.10795362293720245],[0.2817513346672058]

This article reviews and presents a taxonomy of braided river morphodynamic models and discusses the challenges facing model development and use, illustrating these challenges with a case example. The taxonomy is contextualised by an initial discussion of the physical mechanisms of braiding. The taxonomy differentiates between reach-scale and catchment-scale models. Reach-scale models are usually physics-based, which are further divided based upon the mathematical approach used to solve equations (analytical or numerical) and their dimensionality (1D, 2D or 3D). Cellular automata models are one type of numerical model that replace at least some physical processes with expedient rules. A 2D physics-based approach encapsulates sufficient process complexity to provide behavioural predictions. Predictions from catchment-scale landscape evolution models have potential for providing boundary conditions. Future progress in physics-based modelling needs to address three challenges: (i) representation of flow and sediment transport; (ii) temporal and spatial scaling; and (iii) model calibration, sensitivity, uncertainty and validation. The key problem for addressing these is the dearth of laboratory or natural experiment datasets. To show that progress can be made by comparing reach-scale predictions to high-resolution observations, a case study of monitoring and modelling, conducted in the Rees River, New Zealand, is presented. Hydraulic predictions of cellular automata and shallow water equation (Delft3d) models are compared to observed inundation extent. The efficacy of high-resolution, multi-temporal morphological data for assessing 2D physics-based morphodynamic model predictions is also demonstrated. © 2016 The Author(s) Geography Compass © 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",2016,2024-11-21 20:41:53,2024-11-21 21:49:22,,102-127,,3,10,,,,,,,,,,English,,,,,,,Publisher: Blackwell Publishing,,C:\Users\johan\Zotero\storage\6GJCF9AK\Williams et al. - 2016 - Numerical Modelling of Braided River Morphodynamics Review and Future Challenges.pdf,,sediment transport; shallow-water equation; Review; Recommendations; numerical model; morphodynamics; computer simulation; boundary condition; braided river; catchment; cellular automaton; fluvial geomorphology; New Zealand; Otago; Rees River; South Island,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Google-Scholar,NumericalModellingofBraidedRiverMorphodynamicsReviewandFutureChallenges,[0.016705095767974854],[0.0534033365547657],[0.9658029079437256],[0.10851917415857315],[0.04917643591761589],[0.05208601802587509],[0.9457511901855469],[0.0427621491253376],[0.009840806014835835],[0.0063021220266819],[0.0021997978910803795],[0.16337870061397552]

The coupled system of hydrodynamic and morphodynamic equations is solved by finite volume method using Godunov scheme. Roe's approximate Riemann solver is used to calculate the inviscid fluxes. The use of unstructured mesh makes the model applicable to complex domains. However, it is difficult to evaluate the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the Jacobian matrix in the global coordinate. The method proposed herein to deal with this difficulty is to transform the system into the local coordinate with one of the axes in the same direction as the interface outward normal vector. In the local coordinate system, the Jacobian matrix is simplified and the eigenvalues are analyzed using asymptotic method. Regular expansion breaks down when the flow is near critical. Uniformity of the expansion is achieved by changing the scales. Rotational invariance theorem is used to relate the interfacial fluxes in the global and local coordinate systems. Special treatment of the source term on unstructured grid makes the scheme stable and physically balanced (both mass and momentum). The method proposed in this paper for the eigen-system is very efficient comparing to iterative numerical methods.

The idea has recently emerged that the variability in the bed form geometry results from some randomness in sediment flux. In this paper, we address this issue by using the Exner equation and a population exchange model derived in an earlier paper. In this model, particle entrainment and deposition are idealized as population exchanges between the stream and the bed, which makes it possible to use birth-death Markov process theory to track the number of moving grains. The paper focuses on nascent bed forms on initially planar beds, a situation in which the coupling between the stream and bed is weak. In a steady state, the number of moving particles follows a negative binomial distribution. Although this probability distribution does not enter the family of heavy-tailed distributions, it may give rise to large and frequent fluctuations because the standard deviation can be much larger than the mean, a feature that is not accounted for with classic probability laws (e.g., Hamamori's law) used so far for describing bed load fluctuations. In the large-system limit, the master equation of the birth-death Markov process can be transformed into a Fokker-Planck equation. This transformation is used here to show that the number of moving particles can be described as an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process. An important consequence is that in the long term, the number of moving particles follows a Gaussian distribution. Laboratory experiments show that this approximation is correct when the mean number per unit length of stream, equation image/L, is sufficiently large (typically two particles per centimeter in our experiments). The particle number fluctuations give rise to bed elevation fluctuations, whose spectrum falls off like ω−2 in the high-frequency regime (with ω the angular frequency) and variance grows linearly with time. These features are in agreement with recent observations on bed form development (in particular, ripple growth).",2010,2024-11-21 21:48:33,2024-12-01 00:36:00,,,,F2,115,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Publisher: Wiley Online Library,,C:\Users\johan\Zotero\storage\MX45XET7\Ancey - 2010 - Stochastic modeling in sediment dynamics Exner equation for planar bed incipient bed load transport.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Google-Scholar,StochasticmodelinginsedimentdynamicsExnerequationforplanarbedincipientbedloadtransportconditions,[0.7178532481193542],[0.030128860846161842],[0.5221906900405884],[0.13695429265499115],[0.028707077726721764],[0.060086652636528015],[0.026056306436657906],[0.8124957084655762],[0.048271190375089645],[0.0036358085926622152],[0.0018066850025206804],[0.11606086790561676]

This model has proved useful, in particular through numerical simulations, for hydraulic engineering purposes (like estimating the mass of sediments that is drained through an open dam). Though, the model is also coarse. And its applicability at various space and time scales remains a question of considerable interest for sedimentologists. In particular, physical experiments from the grain scale to the laboratory scale reveal important fluctuations of the solid flux in given hydrodynamical conditions. This work is a preliminary study of the coupling of a stochastic Exner equation with a hydrody-namical model for large scales. (Stochastic models with a probabilistic solid flux are currently being investigated, but most often only from the viewpoint of theoretical physics at the grain scale.)

Given that Exner’s model takes the form of a nonlinear hyperbolic equation, one expects, depending on the given initial condition of the bed, the formation of discontinuities in the solution in finite time. The analytical solution provided by Exner for his model is the so-called classical or genuine solution of the initial-value problem, which is valid while the solution is continuous.

The mathematical expression modeling the the hydrodynamic and morphodynamic components of the physical phenomenon are treated to deal with cross-section shape variations and empirical solid discharge estimations. The resulting coupled system of equations can be rewritten as a nonconservative hyperbolic system with three moving waves and one stationary wave to account for the source terms discretization. But, even for the simplest solid transport models as the Grass law, to find a linearized Jacobian matrix of the system can be a challenge if one considers arbitrary shape channels. Moreover, the bottom channel slope variations depends on the erosion-deposition mechanism considered to update the channel cross-section profile. In this paper a numerical finite volume scheme is proposed, based on an augmented Roe solver (first order accurate in time and space) and dealing with solid transport flux variations caused by the channel geometry changes. Channel crosssection variations lead to the appearance of a new solid flux source term which should be discretized properly.

The fundamental aim is to understand if it is possible to capture the main features of some typical meso-scale bedforms, namely river dunes and/or antidunes, through a depth averaged approach, avoiding the numerical integration of full Navier-Stokes Equations by means of RANS or LES approach. The analysis regards the typical range of fluvial hydraulics, that is low sediment transport rate and negligible collisional effects between solid grains. The governing equations are the mass and momentum balance in the shallow water frame and the Exner equation for the bed elevation. Some classical results, considered as stated by the literature on this topic, are taken into account, namely the effects of the skin fiction and of the local bottom slope on the sediment mobility, the key parameter to evaluate the bed load transport. A source of uncertainties is the separation between the form drag effect and the skin friction effect in evaluating the total friction in a bedform-covered alluvial bottom. In order to separate such effects, we remove the average longitudinal bed slope from the momentum equation, and it is idealized as the external forcing which establishes the average mean flow in the considered domain. Firstly, a quasi-analytical approach is adopted, considering as small the sediment discharge with respect to the liquid discharge. The flux matrix eigenvalues and eigenvectors are found, and it is shown how sediment transport affects bedforms celerity and Riemann invariants. Secondly, a relaxation approach is proposed, to take properly into account the bedload time-adaptation to the local hydrodynamic conditions. In both cases, numerical computations are carried out using the Dumbser-Toro extension of the Osher Riemann Solver to non-conservative hyperbolic systems, in order to properly take into account the role of the bottom elevation as time-space variable. Some examples are shown, in typical range of existence of real river bedforms.",2014,2024-12-01 00:35:32,2024-12-01 02:51:41,,506–507,,,,,,,,,,,ECMI,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Google-Scholar,SomeresultsonthenumericaltreatmentofMovableBedShallowWaterEquations,[0.9988372921943665],[0.034521058201789856],[0.29007506370544434],[0.09178834408521652],[0.019032660871744156],[0.03993731364607811],[0.027690257877111435],[0.5410621166229248],[0.0048203435726463795],[0.0008969391346909106],[0.0025016970466822386],[0.060363009572029114]

Nevertheless, other possible applications exist. In particular, bed-load transport phenomena are relevant in urban drainage systems, including sewers. However, few applications of coupled two-dimensional (2D) shallow-water and bed-load transport models can be found, and their transfer from environmental applications?usually river and floodplain?into sewer applications requires some adaptation. Unlike to river systems, where there is a thick layer of sediment that constitutes a movable riverbed, sewer systems have thin layers of sediment that need to be removed, thus exposing a rigid, nonerodible surface.

The Exner equation is used to model the morphological evolution of the bed, while a closure equation is needed to evaluate the rate of sediment transport. The system of Saint-Venant-Exner equations is solved in a fully coupled way using a finite-volume technique and a HLLC solver for the fluxes, with a novel wave-speed estimator adapted to the Exner equation. Wave speeds are usually derived by computing the eigenvalues of the full system, which is highly time-consuming when no analytical expression is available. In this paper, an eigenvalue analysis of the full system is conducted, leading to simple but still accurate wave-speed estimators.

The flow hydrodynamics is represented by the shallow water equations, and the bed morphodynamics is represented by the Exner equation and an additional equation describing the nonequilibrium sediment transport. Sediment size distribution is represented by the median grain diameter and the standard deviation, instead of the usual modeling with multiple particle size classes. Various methods for computing bed elevation changes at a cross section due to erosion or deposition of sediment are proposed and tested, including an innovative approach that relates the spatial pattern of erosion and deposition rates to boundary shear stress distribution, which is calculated by the Merged Perpendicular Method. An explicit finite difference scheme is employed for solving the water and sediment governing equations. The pertinence of the model is examined for two hypothetical cases. The model is then tested on one set of laboratory experiments on bed degradation under steady flow, showing excellent model data fit, and indicating that incorporating a nonequilibrium sediment transport equation into the model structure is an important element in reproducing the bed degradation process. Finally, the model is applied to simulate the morphological changes taking place in the Ha! Ha! River (Quebec) after the failure of the Ha! Ha! Dyke on July 1996. Relevant results can be obtained in terms of changes in longitudinal bed profile and cross-sectional geometry as well as water levels, although some discrepancies are obtained between the simulated and surveyed cross-sectional geometries, mainly because bank failure and channel widening are not modeled.",2009-05-07,2024-11-20 00:35:49,2024-12-01 00:02:27,,,,,45.0,,,,,,,,,,English,,,,,,,"Place: 2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA Publisher: AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION Type: Article",,C:\Users\johan\Zotero\storage\TRMUSQZB\Abderrezzak and Paquier - 2009 - One-dimensional numerical modeling of sediment transport and bed deformation in open channels.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Web-of-Science,Onedimensionalnumericalmodelingofsedimenttransportandbeddeformationinopenchannels,[0.8526290059089661],[0.49384334683418274],[0.0030873690266162157],[0.23135361075401306],[0.8764758706092834],[0.8556100130081177],[0.9487751126289368],[0.5436205267906189],[0.018404889851808548],[0.008283628150820732],[0.03551093861460686],[0.9373829960823059]

The solution strategy relies on a full coupling of the governing equations within each time step. The resulting system of governing equations contains nonconservative products related to the longitudinal and lateral bed slopes and source terms related to friction. The full problem is solved numerically on unstructured triangular grids, simultaneously updating the principal part and adding the source terms (friction) using a splitting technique. The principal part is solved by means of a novel second-order accurate upwind-biased centred scheme of the finite volume type, while the source terms are added to the problem by solving a system of ordinary differential equations. A new algorithm for treating the wetting-and-drying is also proposed. The model is applied to well-established test problems in order to verify the accuracy of the proposed method, the robustness of the wetting-and-drying algorithm and the ability of the model in dealing with transcritical flows. Finally we test the model ability to reproduce two dimensional morphodynamic processes occurring at the scale of tens of channel widths in bedload dominated alluvial rivers with homogeneous grain size. This is achieved by comparing model outcomes with those of analytical theories and flume experiments on the same morphodynamic processes. These selected “benchmarks” include migrating free bars spontaneously developing in straight reaches, steady bars forced by abrupt river planform changes and the dynamics of channel bifurcations.

A detailed analysis is given of existing and novel procedures for the solution of the morphodynamic problem. Coupling of NSWE and Exner equations and updating of the solution is made by means of a sequential splitting scheme. The model has been validated by reproducing both analytical and numerical solutions, available in the recent literature, as well as an in-house laboratory experiment. The simulation of existing theoretical solutions has revealed the model performs well, especially in the prediction of the seabed evolution due to either bed-load or suspended-load transport forced by dam-break and swash-type events. The latter ones are seen to force both erosion and accretion despite the weak hydro-morphodynamic coupling. The comparison between solver results and experimental data is also encouraging, the solver reproducing well the main seabed features forced by irregular waves. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

First we show that the Saint-Venant-Exner equations are linearly unstable in most cases for a uniform base flow down an inclined erodible bed for Shields numbers in excess of the threshold for incipient sediment motion allowing us to compute noise-induced pattern formation for Froude numbers below 2. The wavelength of the bed forms are selected naturally due to the absolute character of the bed instability and the existence of a maximum growth rate at a finite wavelength when the particle diffusivity coefficient and the water eddy viscosity are present as for Turing-like instability. A num e rical method is subsequently developed to analyze the performance of the model and theoretical results through three examples: the simulation of the fluctuations of the particle concentration using a stochastic Langevin equation, the deterministic simulation of anti-dunes formation over an erodible slope in full sediment-mobility conditions, and the computation of noise-induced pattern formation in hybrid stochasticdeterministic flows down a periodic flume. The full non-linear numerical simulations are in excellent agreement with the theoretical solutions. We conclude highlighting that the proposed depth-averaged formulation explains the developments of upstream migrating anti-dunes in straight flumes since the seminar experiments by Gilbert (1914).

It is found that full coupling with the beach, although still resulting in the net offshore transport of sediment throughout the swash zone, leads to a large reduction in the net offshore transport of sediment from the beach face. This is particularly true for the upper third of the swash zone. Moreover, in contradistinction to swash flows over non-erodible beds, flows over erodible beaches are unique to the bed mobility and porosity under consideration; this has very important implications for run-up predictions.

The model solves the nonlinear shallow water equations coupled with the Exner sediment balance equation for the mobile bed. Quasi-analytical solutions to this problem for different expressions for instantaneous sediment discharge formulae are used to test the performance of the scheme. Together with the existing solution for the Grass formula, a further solution is obtained for a different formula.

A system comprising shallow water equations and Exner equation is solved, in which sediment transport rate q is either dependent only on depth averaged velocity (u), or on u and water depth (12). The results are in agreement with equivalent uncoupled results [2] in that all sediment transport formulae considered applied to the event of [1] yield net erosion in the whole of the swash. Consistent with [3], however, full coupling yields significantly less erosion for all the q = q(u) formulae compared to the equivalent uncoupled results. It is shown that differences between uncoupled and coupled approaches (for most formulae) accumulate over the course of the swash event. The main reason for the reduced net erosion is the smaller maximum inundation. It is also shown that including a dependence on h in the bed load sediment transport formula for fully coupled simulations can result in net deposition in the upper swash. Bed shear stress described by a Chezy law is further included in fully coupled simulations to examine net beach change. Much reduced maximum inundation and net offshore sediment transport are predicted both for q = q(u) and q = q(h,u). It is shown that although the net sediment flux at the base of the swash under one [1] swash event is still offshore, deposition in the middle or upper swash may be predicted when bed shear stress is included, particularly when the drag coefficient in the backwash is reduced compared to that in the uprush, consistent with some in-situ measurements. The implication is that bed shear stress must be included not just to obtain correct quantitative beach change, but also to obtain correct qualitative beach behaviour. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

However, the impact of this technique on the hydraulics conditions, and resulting bed morphology, is yet to be understood. Several numerical tools have been developed during last years for modeling sediment transport and morphology evolution which can be used for this application. These models range from 1D to 3D approaches: the first being over simplistic for the simulation of such a complex geometry; the latter requires often a prohibitive computational effort. However, 2D models are computationally efficient and in these cases may already provide sufficiently accurate predictions of the morphology evolution caused by the sediment replenishment in a river. Here, the 2D shallow water equations in combination with the Exner equation are solved by means of a weak-coupled strategy. The classical friction approach considered for reproducing the bed channel roughness has been modified to take into account the morphological effect of replenishment which provokes a channel bed fining. Computational outcomes are compared with four sets of experimental data obtained from several replenishment configurations studied in the laboratory. The experiments differ in terms of placement volume and configuration. A set of analysis parameters is proposed for the experimental-numerical comparison, with particular attention to the spreading, covered surface and travel distance of placed replenishment grains. The numerical tool is reliable in reproducing the overall tendency shown by the experimental data. The effect of fining roughness is better reproduced with the approach herein proposed. However, it is also highlighted that the sediment clusters found in the experiment are not well numerically reproduced in the regions of the channel with a limited number of sediment grains.

In this paper, these equations are combined with the two-dimensional shallow water equations to describe the flow field. The resulting system of equations can be solved in two ways: (i) in a coupled way, solving flow and sediment equations simultaneously at a given time-step or (ii) in an uncoupled manner by first solving the flow field and using the magnitudes obtained at each time-step to update the channel morphology (bed and surface composition). The coupled strategy is preferable when dealing with strong and quick interactions between the flow field, the bed evolution and the different particle sizes present on the bed surface. A number of numerical difficulties at from solving the fully coupled system of equations. These problems are reduced by means of a weakly-coupled strategy to numerically estimate the wave celerities containing the information of the bed and the grain sizes present on the bed. Hence, a two-dimensional numerical scheme able to simulate in a self-stable way the unsteady morphological evolution of channels formed by cohesionless grain size mixtures is presented. The coupling technique is simplified without decreasing the number of waves involved in the numerical scheme but by simplifying their definitions. The numerical results are satisfactorily tested with synthetic cases and against experimental data. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The method is based on the floating grid-of-characteristics approach, which here is amended to take account of the more complex structure of the field of characteristics inherent in the morphodynamics (compared to those for hydro- or gas dynamics). Due to the relative simplicity of the algorithm the technique is particularly well suited to waves moving into a downstream reach that is initially dry. As with all MOC schemes the approach is also attractive because it reveals the underlying (morpho)dynamics as the solution progresses. The mathematical model considered here is based on the depth averaged non-linear shallow water equations directly coupled to a bed update (Exner) equation. Closure is obtained using a simple sediment flux relation. The technique described allows the study of fully coupled sediment transport problems and the associated hydro- and morphodynamic evolution. Numerical results are presented for the evolution of a sand dune in a tidal flow as well as the wet-dry dam-break problem on both a fixed and mobile bed. Results compare extremely well with the analytical or quasi-analytical solutions for the problems presented. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Moreover, these models are usually not well-balanced, meaning they are unable to correctly simulate quiescent flow. Here a well-balanced and flexible morphological model for the swash zone is presented. The nonlinear shallow water equations and the Exner equation are discretized by the shock-capturing finite volume method, in which the numerical flux and the bed slope source term are estimated by a well-balanced version of the SLIC (slope limited centered) scheme that does not depend on empirical sediment transport relations. The satisfaction of the well-balanced property is demonstrated through simulating quiescent coastal flow. The quantitative accuracy of the model in reproducing key parameters (i.e., the notional shoreline position, the swash depth, the flow velocity, the overtopping flow volume, the beach change depth and the sediment transport rate) is shown to be satisfactory through comparisons against analytical solutions, experimental data as well as previous numerical solutions. This work facilitates an improved modeling framework for the swash hydrodynamics and sediment transport. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

However, the resolution of the sediment continuity equation to simulate bed evolution is a complex problem which often leads to the development of numerical oscillations. To overcome this problem, addition of artificial diffusion or bathymetric filters are commonly employed methods, although these techniques can potentially over-smooth the bathymetry. This study aims to present a numerical scheme based on the Weighted Essentially Non-Oscillatory (WENO) formalism to solve the bed continuity equation on unstructured grids in a finite volume formulation. The new solution is compared against a classical method, which combines a basic node-centered finite volume method with artificial diffusion, for three idealized test cases. This comparison reveals that a higher accuracy is obtained with our new method while the addition of diffusion appears inappropriate mainly due to the arbitrary choice of the diffusion coefficient. Moreover, the increased computation time associated with the WENO-based method to solve the bed continuity equation is negligible when considering a fully-coupled simulation with tides and waves. Finally, the application of the new method to the pluri-monthly evolution of an idealized inlet subjected to tides and waves shows the development of realistic bed features (e.g. secondary flood channels, ebb-delta sandbars, or oblique sandbars at the adjacent beaches), that are smoothed or nonexistent when using additional diffusion.

The DOT path-conservative scheme is a robust upwind method based on a complete Riemann solver, but it has the drawback of requiring expensive numerical computations. Indeed, to compute the non-linear time evolution in each time step, the DOT scheme requires numerical computation of the flux matrix eigenstructure (the totality of eigenvalues and eigenvectors) several times at each cell edge. In this work, an analytical and compact formulation of the eigenstructure for the de Saint Venant-Exner (dSVE) model is introduced and tested in terms of numerical efficiency and stability. Using the original DOT and PRICE-C (a very efficient FORCE-type method) as reference methods, we present a convergence analysis (error against CPU time) to study the performance of the DOT method with our new analytical implementation of eigenstructure calculations (A-DOT). In particular, the numerical performance of the three methods is tested in three test cases: a movable bed Riemann problem with analytical solution; a problem with smooth analytical solution; a test in which the water flow is characterised by subcritical and supercritical regions.

The method can be viewed as a truly meshless method as it does not need any mesh for both field variable approximation and the construction of system matrices; it also provides the symmetric coefficient matrix.

At the end, a real test problem is performed to show and verify the main benefit and applicability of the proposed method to cope with complex geometry in practical problems. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

The method is based on the original Lagrangian-Eulerian CSPH-TVD approach for solving the Saint-Venant and Exner equations, taking into account the physical factors essential for the understanding of the shallow water and surface soil layer motions, including complex terrain structure and its evolution due to sediment transport. Additional Exner equation for sediment transport has been used for the numerical CSPH-TVD scheme stability criteria definition. By using OpenMP-CUDA and GPUDirect technologies for hybrid computing systems (supercomputers) with several graphic coprocessors (GPUs) interacting with each other via the PCI-E/NVLINK interface we also develop a parallel numerical algorithm for the CSPH-TVD method. The developed parallel version of the algorithm demonstrates high efficiency for various configurations of Nvidia Tesla CPU + GPU computing systems. In particular, maximal speed up is 1800 for a system with four C2070 GPUs compare to the serial version for the CPU. The calculation time on the GPU V100 (Volta architecture) is reduced by 95 times compared to the GPU C2070 (Fermi architecture). © 2020, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.",2020,2024-11-21 20:41:53,2024-12-01 00:02:05,,1475-1484,,8,41.0,,,,,,,,,,English,,,,,,,Publisher: Pleiades journals,,C:\Users\johan\Zotero\storage\RLGLH5PT\Khrapov and Khoperskov - 2020 - Application of Graphics Processing Units for Self-Consistent Modelling of Shallow Water Dynamics and.pdf,,OpenMP; SWE-Exner; parallel computing; GPU; HPC; 2D; CUDA; Numerical Method; GPUs; numerical methods; shallow water model,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Web-of-Science,ApplicationofGraphicsProcessingUnitsforSelfConsistentModellingofShallowWaterDynamicsandSedimentTransport,[0.013121270574629307],[0.9975985884666443],[0.19421495497226715],[0.05179748311638832],[0.0645354762673378],[0.026912303641438484],[0.9998928308486938],[0.014871002174913883],[0.004264634568244219],[0.01540972851216793],[0.004477080889046192],[0.0033897836692631245]

The governing equations consist of three coupled model components: (i) the shallow water equations for the hydrodynamical model, (ii) a transport equation for the dispersion of suspended sediments, and (iii) an Exner equation for the morphological model. These coupled models form a hyperbolic system of conservation laws with source terms. The proposed finite volume method consists of a predictor stage for the discretization of gradient terms and a corrector stage for the treatment of source terms. The gradient fluxes are discretized using a modified Roe's scheme using the sign of the Jacobian matrix in the coupled system. A well-balanced discretization is used for the treatment of source terms. In this paper, we also describe an adaptive procedure in the finite volume method by monitoring the concentration of suspended sediments in the computational domain during its transport process. The method uses unstructured meshes, incorporates upwinded numerical fluxes and slope limiters to provide sharp resolution of steep sediment concentration and bed-load gradients that may form in the approximate solution. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2011.",2011,2024-11-21 21:06:48,2024-12-01 00:02:01,,875 – 891,,,4.0,,,,,,,,Springer Verlag,,English,,,,,,,ISSN: 21905614 Type: Article,,C:\Users\johan\Zotero\storage\WHTXBMD8\Benkhaldoun et al. - 2011 - A two-dimensional finite volume solution of dam-break hydraulics over erodible sediment beds.pdf,,Finite volume method; Sediment transport; Sedimentation; Suspended sediments; SWE-Exner; shallow water equations; Shallow water equations; 2D; Numerical Method; FVM; Equations of motion; finite volume method; Hydraulics; Governing equations; Jacobian matrices; Numerical methods; Approximate solution; Computational domains; Finite volume solution; Hydrodynamical model; Hyperbolic system of conservation laws; Sediment concentration; Two dimensional,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Web-of-Science,Atwodimensionalfinitevolumesolutionofdambreakhydraulicsovererodiblesedimentbeds,[0.7691669464111328],[0.6595147848129272],[0.9989119172096252],[0.9997463226318359],[0.7151256799697876],[0.29982221126556396],[0.9894703030586243],[0.016355833038687706],[0.010509382002055645],[0.08670936524868011],[0.003033736487850547],[0.01621503010392189]

We show that, for some bedload transport models like the well-known Meyer-Peter and Müller model, the system is hyperbolic and, thus, linearly stable, only under some constraint on the velocity. In practical situations, this condition is hopefully fulfilled. Numerical approximations of such system are often based on a splitting method, solving first shallow water equation on a time step and, updating afterwards the topography. It is shown that this strategy can create spurious/unphysical oscillations which are related to the study of hyperbolicity. Using an upper bound of the largest eigenvector may improve the results although the instabilities cannot be always avoided, e.g. in supercritical regions.",2011,2024-11-21 21:48:33,2024-12-01 00:35:49,,980–989,,8,34.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Publisher: Elsevier,,"C:\Users\johan\Zotero\storage\27ZC6E6I\Cordier et al. - 2011 - Bedload transport in shallow water models Why splitting (may) fail, how hyperbolicity (can) help.pdf",,Sediment transport; Exner equation; Stability; Hyperbolicity; Shallow water system; Splitting methods,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Web-of-Science,BedloadtransportinshallowwatermodelsWhysplittingmayfailhowhyperbolicitycanhelp,[0.9989857077598572],[0.08882030099630356],[0.3261640965938568],[0.14169658720493317],[0.09756221622228622],[0.3687465786933899],[0.25701844692230225],[0.060529377311468124],[0.000938111508730799],[0.00930394884198904],[0.0011559007689356804],[0.7083134651184082]

Theoretical models based on two-dimensional shallow water and Exner equations have been successfully employed to capture the bar instability phenomenon, and to estimate bar properties such as height, wavelength and migration rate. However, the mathematical complexity of the problem hampered the understanding of the key physical mechanisms that sustain bar formation. To fill this gap, we considered a simplified version of the equations, based on neglecting the deformation of the free surface, which allows us to: (a) provide the first complete explanation of the bar formation mechanism as the result of a simple bond between variations of the water weight and flow acceleration; (b) derive a simplified, physically based formula for predicting bar formation in a river reach, depending on channel width-to-depth ratio, Shields number and relative submergence. Comparison with an unprecedented large set of laboratory experiments reveals that our simplified formula appropriately predicts alternate bar formation in a wide range of conditions. Noteworthy, the hypothesis of negligible free surface effect also implies that bar formation is fully independent of the Froude number. We show that this intriguing property is intimately related to the three-dimensional nature of river bars, which allows for a gentle lateral deviation of the flow without significant deformation of the water surface.",2021-12,2024-11-22 21:19:57,2024-12-01 00:02:10,,,,12,57.0,,,,,,,,,,English,,,,,,,"Place: 2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA Publisher: AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION Type: Article",,C:\Users\johan\Zotero\storage\YA66ZL29\Redolfi - 2021 - Free Alternate Bars in Rivers Key Physical Mechanisms and Simple Formation Criterion.pdf,,sediment transport; river; instability; alternate bars; formation criterion; formation mechanism,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Web-of-Science,FreeAlternateBarsinRiversKeyPhysicalMechanismsandSimpleFormationCriterion,[0.30590465664863586],[0.02313133515417576],[0.1536126434803009],[0.19125214219093323],[0.01361058745533228],[0.1211128756403923],[0.010388216003775597],[0.8895288705825806],[0.06992184370756149],[0.007907291874289513],[0.002327693859115243],[0.04410091042518616]

The presence of underlying bedrock strata covered by erodible bed layers is ubiquitous in rivers and estuaries. In the last years, the development of models based on the non-capacity sediment transport assumption, also called non-equilibrium assumption, has offered a new theoretical background to deal with complex non-erodible bed configurations and the associated numerical problems. Bedload non-capacity sediment transport models consider that the actual solid transport state can be different from the equilibrium state and depending on the temporal evolution of the flow. The treatment of finite-depth erodible bed layers, i.e. partially erodible beds, in bedload models based on the equilibrium approach has usually been made using numerical fixes, which correct the unphysical results obtained in some cases. Generally, the presence of a finite-depth erodible layer implies the introduction of a kind of non-equilibrium condition in the bedload transport state. Nevertheless, this common natural bed configuration has not been previously considered in the development of numerical models. In this work, a finite volume model (FVM) for bedload transport based on non-capacity approach and dealing with finite-depth erodible layers is proposed. New expressions for the actual bedload transport rate and the net exchange flux through the static-moving bed layers interface are used to develop a numerical scheme which solves the coupled shallow water and non-capacity bedload transport system of equations. The reconstruction of the intermediate states for the local Riemann problem at each intercell edge is designed to correctly model the presence of non-erodible strata, avoiding the appearance of unphysical results in the approximate solution without reducing the time step. The new coupled scheme is tested against laboratory benchmarking experiments in order to demonstrate its stability and accuracy, pointing out the properties of both equilibrium and non-equilibrium formulations.",2019-08,2024-11-22 21:19:57,2024-12-01 00:01:51,,91-112,,,130.0,,,,,,,,,,English,,,,,,,"Place: THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND Publisher: ELSEVIER SCI LTD Type: Article",,C:\Users\johan\Zotero\storage\9PASBC3D\Martinez-Aranda et al. - 2019 - A comparative analysis of capacity and non-capacity formulations for the simulation of unsteady flow.pdf,,Finite volume method; Shallow water equations; Augmented Roe's scheme; Finite-depth erodible layer; Fully coupled method; Non-capacity bedload transport,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Web-of-Science,Acomparativeanalysisofcapacityandnoncapacityformulationsforthesimulationofunsteadyflowsoverfinitedeptherodiblebeds,[0.9987453818321228],[0.3010023832321167],[0.26635727286338806],[0.9864678382873535],[0.7810802459716797],[0.3554392158985138],[0.8411744236946106],[0.08601588755846024],[0.0445975735783577],[0.01709447242319584],[0.003572682850062847],[0.2308330535888672]

In these conditions bed load is the dominant mode of sediment transport. Laboratory experiments of a single bore-driven swash event are simulated numerically using a fully-coupled model that solves the system of Non Linear Shallow Water Equations and the Exner sediment conservation formula. The analysis focuses on two aspects: the optimal choice of parameters for the Meyer-Peter and Muller sediment transport formula and the model used for computing the shear stress. The methods tested for the bed shear stress are the momentum integral method and the Chezy formulation in which the friction factor is computed using two different formulae. Infiltration into the beach and its effects on the shear stress and sediment transport are also modelled. Results show that the basic Meyer-Peter and Muller sediment transport formula provides good results in the run-up. On the other hand, the sediment transport in the early stage of the backwash is overestimated. A reduction of the sediment mobility constant in the formula in the backwash marginally improves the results. However, the causes of the overestimation of the sediment transport at the early stage of the backwash is the overestimation of the shear stress, while at later stages there are several contributions that are identified, i.e. modelling of the sediment transport and infiltration. It is also suggested that the Meyer-Peter and Muller sediment transport formula might not capture the complexity of the processes involved during the backwash. The comparison of the methods for the estimate of the bed shear stress show that comparable results can be obtained using the momentum integral method and the Chezy formulation with time and space varying friction factor. The resulting bed evolution is also described. In the predicted final profile, deposition is found in the upper part of the beach and erosion in the lower part. A bed step is formed just below the position of the initial shoreline. This feature is determined by the onset of a hydraulic jump during the backwash.",2018-12,2024-11-22 21:19:57,2024-12-01 00:02:23,,62-76,,,142.0,,,,,,,,,,English,,,,,,,"Place: PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS Publisher: ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV Type: Article",,C:\Users\johan\Zotero\storage\YCUM89LA\Briganti et al. - 2018 - Numerical modelling of the flow and bed evolution of a single bore-driven swash event on a coarse sa.pdf,,Bed load; Swash zone; Morphodynamics; Coarse sediment beach,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Web-of-Science,Numericalmodellingoftheflowandbedevolutionofasingleboredrivenswasheventonacoarsesandbeach,[0.9985221028327942],[0.6482437252998352],[0.3629409670829773],[0.5039443373680115],[0.7758595943450928],[0.6239499449729919],[0.16491955518722534],[0.1294577568769455],[0.027742890641093254],[0.5984588861465454],[0.026255302131175995],[0.6923820376396179]

A multi-scale analysis is performed in order to take into account that the velocity of the sediment layer is smaller than the one of the fluid layer. This leads us to consider a shallow water type system for the fluid layer and a lubrication Reynolds equation for the sediment one. This deduction provides some improvements with respect to the classic Saint-Venant-Exner model: (i) the deduced model has an associated energy. Moreover, it allows us to explain why classic models do not have an associated energy and how they can be modified in order to recover a model with this property. (ii) The model incorporates naturally a necessary modification that must be taken into account in order to be applied to arbitrarily sloping beds. Furthermore, we show that in general this modification is different from the ones considered classically. Nevertheless, it coincides with a classic one in the case of constant free surface. (iii) The deduced solid transport discharge naturally depends on the thickness of the moving sediment layer, which allows to ensure sediment mass conservation.

The numerical model is expressed in a fully-coupled form where a single system of equations is solved by a high resolution two-dimensional finite volume scheme of the relaxation type.

The governing equation is the modified 1D shallow water equation and the Exner equation that take both bed load and suspended load transport into account. The non-equilibrium sediment transport algorithm was adopted in the model, and the van Rijn method was employed to calculate the bed-load transport rate and the concentration of suspended sediment at the reference level. Flux terms in the governing equations were discretised using the upwind flux scheme, Harten et al. (1983) (HLL) and HLLC schemes, Roe's scheme and the Weighted Average Flux (WAF) schemes with the Double Minmod and Minmod flux limiters. The model was tested under a fixed bed condition to evaluate the performance of several different numerical schemes and then applied to an experimental case of dam break flow over a mobile bed and a flood event in the Rillito River, Tucson, Arizona. For dam break flow over movable bed, all tested schemes were proved to be capable of reasonably simulating water surface profiles, but failed to accurately capture the hydraulic jump. The WAF schemes produced slight spurious oscillations at the water surface and bed profiles and over-estimated the scour depth. When applying the model to the Rillito River, the simulated results generally agreed well with the field measurements of flow discharges and bed elevation changes. Modeling results of bed elevation changes were sensitive to the suspended load recovery coefficient and the bed load adaptation length, which require further theoretical and experimental investigations.

It is shown that a well balanced 2D model can predict flow features, sediment and scalar concentration, and bed elevation with an accuracy that is suitable for practical river engineering. The term “balanced” implies that important physical processes are modeled with a similar degree of complexity and exhaustiveness. The starting point of the model formulation is the assumption of self-similarity of vertical velocity profiles (horizontal velocities in the longitudinal and transverse directions), that are scaled by shear velocity and streamline curvature, both resolved by the model. The former is scaled by a bed-resistance coefficient that must be estimated or calibrated - as usual on a application-specific basis, and the latter is computed by a new, grid-based but grid orientation independent, scheme that acts on the discrete solution. All processes, including bottom shear, momentum dispersion, scalar dispersion, turbulent diffusion, bed load, and suspended load, are modeled using physically based, averaged values of empirical or semi-empirical constants, and consistently with the assumed velocity profiles (and bed-generated turbulence). Bed deformation modeling can be implemented with either an equilibrium or non-equilibrium formulation of the Exner equation, depending on the adaptation length scale, which must be taken under consideration if significantly larger than the length scale of the spatial discretization. The governing equations are solved by high-resolution, unstructured-grid Godunov method, which is elsewhere tested and shown to be reliable and second-order accurate. Application of the model to laboratory test cases, using standard parameter values and previously reported bed-resistance coefficients, gives results comparable to many 2D and 3D models previously applied to the same cases, most part of which benefit from case-specific parameter tuning. There are obviously intrinsic limits to the descriptive ability of 2D models in river modeling, but the results of this study point to the utility and cost-effectiveness of a well-designed 2D model.

The analysis is usually conducted focusing the asymptotic fate of small disturbances, using normal modes. In this work we instead have tackled another aspect of the stability problem studying the disturbance behavior at finite times. Recent studies have in fact shown that nonnormality of differential operators can induce a nonmonotonic decay of disturbances in asymptotically stable cases and the occurrence of transient growths. We have investigated these aspects for the de Saint-Venant-Exner equations and discussed the transient behavior of the energy of disturbances for both fixed and movable bed conditions. We show that the former case provides weak levels of nonnormality; while the latter can give rise to important transient growths. These growths result from uniquely linear mechanisms, are potentially able to trigger nonlinear instabilities, and are physically due to a transfer of potential energy between the water stream and the bed.

The set of governing equations is solved using an explicit finite difference scheme. The model is tested in various idealized experimental cases, with fairly good agreement between the numerical predictions and measurements. Discrepancies are observed at the earlier stage of the dam-break wave and around the dam location due to no vertical velocity component being taken into account. Sensitivity tests confirm that the friction coefficient is an important parameter for the evaluation of sediment transport processes operating during a dam-break wave. The influence of the non-equilibrium adaptation length (or the lag distance) is negligible on the wavefront celerity and weak on the free surface and bed profiles, which indicates that one may ignore the spatial lag effect in dam-break wave studies.

The one-dimensional de Saint Venant and Exner equations are solved numerically for the ideal case of a frictionally dominated estuary consisting of noncohesive sediment and with insignificant intertidal storage of water in tidal flats and salt marshes. This class of estuaries turns out to be invariably flood dominated. The resulting asymmetries in surface elevations and tidal currents lead to a net sediment flux within a tidal cycle which is directed landward. As a consequence, sediments are trapped within the estuary and the bottom profile evolves asymptotically toward an equilibrium configuration, allo wing a vanishing net sediment flux everywhere and, in accordance with field observations, a nearly constant value of the maximum flood/ebb speed. Such an equilibrium bed profile is characterized by a concavity increasing as the estuary convergence increases and by a uniquely determined value of the depth at the inlet section. The final length of the estuary is fixed by the longitudinal extension of the very shallow area which tends to form in the landward portion of the estuary.

This model solves shallow water and Exner equations with a weakly coupled approach while the fluxes at the interfaces of the cells are calculated thanks to a lateralized HLLC flux scheme. Besides describing the model, we ran it for four different test cases: a steady flow on an inclined bed leading to aggradation or degradation, a dam-break leading to high interaction between the flow and the bed, a dam-break with a symmetrical enlargement close to the gate and a dam-break in a channel with a 90 degrees bend. The gathered results are discussed and compared to an existing fully coupled approach based on HLLC fluxes. Although both models equally perform regarding water levels, the weakly coupled model looks to better predict the bed evolution for the four test cases. In particular, its results are not affected by an excessive numerical diffusion encountered by the coupled model. Moreover, it usually better estimates the amplitudes of the maximum deposits and scours. It is also more stable when subject to high bed-flow interaction.",2020-09,2024-11-22 21:19:57,2024-12-01 00:01:45,,1351-1369,,5,22.0,,,,,,,,,,English,,,,,,,"Place: ALLIANCE HOUSE, 12 CAXTON ST, LONDON SW1H0QS, ENGLAND Publisher: IWA PUBLISHING Type: Article",,C:\Users\johan\Zotero\storage\638SB6JY\Meurice and Soares-Frazao - 2020 - A 2D HLL-based weakly coupled model for transient flows on mobile beds.pdf,,morphodynamics; dam-break; erodible bed; finite-volumes; HLL; transient flows,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Web-of-Science,A2DHLLbasedweaklycoupledmodelfortransientflowsonmobilebeds,[0.22755512595176697],[0.5411397814750671],[0.9980505704879761],[0.9992777705192566],[0.9906780123710632],[0.6248946189880371],[0.9102267026901245],[0.7332131862640381],[0.018869254738092422],[0.06797851622104645],[0.006351235322654247],[0.21766991913318634]

On the one hand, the equilibrium approach for the bedload transport assumes that the actual transport rate instantaneously adapts to the local flow features. The resulting system of equations, composed of the shallow water equations for the flow (SWE) and the Exner equation for the bed evolution, has been widely used to simulate bedload processes. These capacity SWE + Exner models are highly dependent on the setup parameters, so that the calibration procedure often disguises the advantages and flaws of the numerical method. On the other hand, noncapacity approaches account for the temporal and spatial delay of the actual sediment transport rate with respect to the capacity of the flow. The importance of assuming nonequilibrium conditions in bedload numerical models remains uncertain however. In this work, we compared the performances of three different strategies for the resolution of the SWE + Exner system under capacity and noncapacity conditions to approximate a set of experimental data with fixed setup parameters. The results indicate that the discrete strategy used to compute the intercell fluxes significantly affected the solution. Furthermore, the noncapacity approach can improve the model prediction in regions with complex transient processes, but it requires a careful calibration of the nonequilibrium parameters.",2021-07,2024-12-01 00:01:08,2024-12-01 00:01:08,,,,13,13.0,,,,,,,,,,English,,,,,,,"Place: ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND Publisher: MDPI Type: Article",,C:\Users\johan\Zotero\storage\DBLBXY6N\Martinez-Aranda et al. - 2021 - Comparative Analysis of HLLC- and Roe-Based Models for the Simulation of a Dam-Break Flow in an Erod.pdf,,Exner equation; erodible bed; conservative numerical schemes; dam-break waves; finite volumes; noncapacity bedload; transient morphodynamics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Web-of-Science,ComparativeAnalysisofHLLCandRoeBasedModelsfortheSimulationofaDamBreakFlowinanErodibleChannelwitha90SUPSUPBend,[0.9996339082717896],[0.3832661211490631],[0.2801238000392914],[0.29645052552223206],[0.4265156388282776],[0.39659383893013],[0.6424885988235474],[0.04484790191054344],[0.027980946004390717],[0.2501335144042969],[0.08517510443925858],[0.851212203502655]

Due to the coupling effect among tidal currents, waves, and sediments, an immense sandbar area evolved in the outer subaqueous delta, impeding the flood releasing during wet season, as well as salinity intrusion during the dry season. In this work, an unstructured-grid based morphodynamic model was proposed to simulate the sandbar evolution process in the Modaomen Estuary. The proposed model was constructed by using the two-dimensional shallow water equations for tidal flow, the advection-diffusion equations for salinity and suspended sediment transport, and the non-equilibrium formulation of the Exner equation for bed evolution. To simulate the wave-induced longshore currents in the Modaomen Estuary, an adaptive time-stepping approach was proposed to couple the unstructured-grid based Simulating WAves Nearshore (SWAN) model and the shallow flow model. An integrated solver is proposed for computing flow, salinity, and sediment transport fluxes simultaneously, and then the shallow water equations and advection-diffusion equations are jointly solved by a high-resolution, unstructured-grid Godunov method. Application of the model to the Modaomen Estuary, using calibrated parameter values, gives results comparable to the measured data.

To enforce a unique definition of the discontinuous solutions, we adopt the path-theory introduced by DalMaso, LeFLoch and Murat [18]. According to the path choices, we exhibit several shock definitions and we prove that a shock with a constant propagation speed and a given left state may connect an arbitrary right state. As a consequence, additional assumptions (coming from physical considerations or other arguments) must be chosen to enforce a unique definition. Moreover, we show that numerical ambiguities may still exist even when a path is chosen to select the system's solution.",2015-06,2024-12-01 00:01:08,2024-12-01 00:01:08,,267-294,,3,7.0,,,,,,,,,,English,,,,,,,"Place: ROOM 3208, CENTRAL PLAZA, 18 HARBOUR RD, WANCHAI, HONG KONG 00000, PEOPLES R CHINA Publisher: GLOBAL SCIENCE PRESS Type: Article",,C:\Users\johan\Zotero\storage\VWDTMZJV\Berthon et al. - 2015 - Shock Profiles for the Shallow-Water Exner Models.pdf,,dam-break simulations; Exner models; generalized Rankine-Hugoniot relations; hugoniot curves; nonconservative hyperbolic systems; shock wave solutions,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Web-of-Science,ShockProfilesfortheShallowWaterExnerModels,[0.09982066601514816],[0.022158868610858917],[0.24921879172325134],[0.09122006595134735],[0.012336100451648235],[0.13449148833751678],[0.009633652865886688],[0.011508149094879627],[0.003350423416122794],[0.05660025402903557],[0.0006986756343394518],[0.01578455977141857]

The integrator allows for the exact balance of energy exchanges in space and time for vertical atmospheric motions by preserving the skew-symmetry of the non-canonical Hamiltonian formulation of the compressible Euler equations. The performance of the integrator is accelerated by a preconditioning strategy that reduces the dimensionality of the inner linear system. Here we reduce the four component velocity, density, density weighted potential temperature and Exner pressure system into a single equation for the density weighted potential temperature via repeated Schur complement decomposition and the careful selection of coupling terms. As currently formulated, the integrator is based on a horizontal-vertical spatial splitting that does not permit bottom topography. The integrator is validated for standard test cases for baroclinic instability and a non-hydrostatic gravity wave on the sphere and a rising bubble in a high-resolution planar geometry, and shows robust convergence across all of these regimes.

The hydrodynamic model is developed by solving the two dimensional (2D) shallow water equations using a total variation diminishing (TVD) MacCormack predictor corrector scheme. The present TVD method is very simple and provides accurate results free from numerical oscillations near sharp gradient. The effective stresses are modeled by using a constant eddy viscosity model. The sediment transport model solves the Exner equation using a simple forward time and central space (FTCS) finite difference algorithm. The sediment transport model incorporates the helical flow and the transverse bed slope effects on the sediment direction computation. These models are coupled using the semicoupled approach. The present semicoupled model is used to replicate two popular experimental test cases of both tight and loose channel bends. The obtained results in terms of bed level variation reveal that the model can accurately simulate several features of the bed changes such as oscillations of the transverse bed profile with the formation of point bars and pools along the banks. The values obtained for three widely used statistical parameters show the applicability of the present model for this type of complex scenarios.,2020-09,2024-12-01 00:01:08,2024-12-01 00:01:08,,1611-1622,,5,13.0,,,,,,,,,,English,,,,,,,"Place: MECHANICAL ENGINEEING DEPT, JAFM OFFICE, ISFAHAN, 84156-83111, IRAN Publisher: ISFAHAN UNIV TECHNOLOGY Type: Article",,C:\Users\johan\Zotero\storage\3MQ25AZ9\Bora and Kalita - 2020 - A Semi-Coupled Model for Morphological Flow Simulation in River Bend.pdf,,Exner equation; Shallow water equations; Sediment transport model; FTCS scheme; Semicoupled model; TVD MacCormack scheme,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Web-of-Science,ASemiCoupledModelforMorphologicalFlowSimulationinRiverBend,[0.11787642538547516],[0.7708100080490112],[0.9624619483947754],[0.24409262835979462],[0.837619960308075],[0.6551154255867004],[0.9991880059242249],[0.8594279885292053],[0.026430638507008553],[0.006400730926543474],[0.023779984563589096],[0.33845967054367065]

These conditions allow the generation of incident signals and the absorption of reflected ones, taking into account the bed evolution at the boundary. They use the approximations for linear waves in shallow water and are based on the solution of the Riemann Equations. The proposed technique is implemented in the fully-coupled hydro-morphodynamical numerical model of Briganti et al. (2012a). Firstly, the generation and absorption of single monochromatic waves are studied to quantify the error after the reflected wave exited the domain. In all cases the error is always small, giving evidence of the effectiveness of the new seaward boundary conditions. Furthermore, the propagation and reflection of a monochromatic wave train over a mobile bed are considered. Both flow evolution and bed change are not affected by spurious oscillations when long sequences of waves are tested. Additionally, a very low mobility bed is considered to simulate a `virtually fixed' bed and new boundary condition results consistently converge to those for the hydrodynamic only case. Finally, the reflection of a uniform bore over a mobile bed is studied. For this case the Rankine Hugoniot conditions provide an analytical solution. It is apparent that the adopted linear approximations produce errors in the velocity estimates. Nevertheless, the conditions perform reasonably well even in this demanding non-linear case.

The depth averaged shallow water equations (SWE) have been used to reach the flow pattern, the advection-diffusion equation (ADE) was exploited to determine sediment concentration in the water, bed load was determined by the active layer mass conservation equation (ALMC), while the morphological changes of the river bed were determined by the global active layer mass conservation equation (GALMC), the Exner equation. The SWE are solved by the multiple-relaxation-time lattice Boltzmann method, (MRT-LBM), while the Bhatnagar-Gross-Krook (BGK-LBM) approach has been used for solving the ADE, ALMC and GALMC. New forms of the equilibrium function for solving the ALMC and GALMC are presented, using the D2Q9 lattice. Dedicated sediment-related equations are created for each sediment-size class. Additional dedicated terms in the transport equations take care of particle exchange between the suspension and the river bed, as well as of river bed deformation. The model has been verified on a experimental section of the Danube river. The results have been compared to the measured ones, and to the results obtained by the finite difference method (FDM). Very good agreement between the results is achieved, indicating that the LBM can be successfully used for simulation of flow and sediment related processes in natural watercourses, characterized by complex geometry and morphology, and lack of uniformity in sediment composition.",2022-03,2024-12-01 00:01:08,2024-12-01 00:01:08,,,,,606.0,,,,,,,,,,English,,,,,,,"Place: RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS Publisher: ELSEVIER Type: Article",,,,Morphological changes; Sediment transport; Shallow water equations; Lattice Boltzmann method; Natural watercourses,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Web-of-Science,SedimenttransportandmorphologicalchangesinshallowflowsmodelledwiththelatticeBoltzmannmethod,[0.6356748938560486],[0.7844841480255127],[0.029340030625462532],[0.020081007853150368],[0.028140751644968987],[0.007968815043568611],[0.9878996014595032],[0.28402960300445557],[0.011892049573361874],[0.002929241629317403],[0.007460644003003836],[0.9286680221557617]

Numerical solution algorithms based on discontinuous Galerkin finite element discretizations of the model are proposed. The algorithms include both coupled and decoupled approaches for solving the hydrodynamic and morphodynamic parts simultaneously and separately from each other, respectively. The Strang operator splitting technique is employed to treat the dispersive terms separately, and it provides the ability to ignore the dispersive terms in specified regions, such as surf zones. Algorithms that can handle wetting-drying and detect wave breaking are presented. The numerical solution algorithms are validated with numerical experiments to demonstrate the ability of the algorithms to accurately resolve hydrodynamics of solitary and regular waves, and morphodynamic changes induced by such waves. The results indicate that the model has the potential to be used in studies of coastal morphodynamics driven by dispersive water waves, given that the hydrodynamic part resolves the water motion and dispersive wave effects with sufficient accuracy up to swash zones, and the morphodynamic model can capture the major features of bed erosion and deposition.

The present study investigates, using 2D shallow-water approximation, the morphodynamics and forces caused by a dam-break wave against a rigid obstacle in the presence of an erodible bed. A widely used coupled equilibrium model, based on the two-dimensional Saint-Venant hydrodynamic equations combined with the sediment continuity Exner equation (SVEM), is compared with a more complex two-phase model (TPM). Considering an experimental set-up presented in the literature with a single rigid obstacle in a channel, two series of tests were performed, assuming sand or light sediments on the bottom. The former test is representative of a typical laboratory experiment, and the latter may be scaled up to a field case. For each test, two different particle diameters were considered. Independently from the particle size, it was found that in the sand tests, SVEM performs similarly to TPM. In the case of light sediment, larger differences are observed, and the SVEM predicts a higher force of about 26% for both considered diameters. The analysis of the flow fields and the morphodynamics shows these differences can be essentially ascribed to the role of inertia of the solid particles.",2021-01,2024-12-01 00:01:08,2024-12-01 00:01:08,,,,2,13.0,,,,,,,,,,English,,,,,,,"Place: ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND Publisher: MDPI Type: Article",,C:\Users\johan\Zotero\storage\GCRD27W8\Di Cristo et al. - 2021 - Impact Force of a Geomorphic Dam-Break Wave against an Obstacle Effects of Sediment Inertia.pdf,,Exner equation; dam-break; mobile bed; impact force; two-phase model,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Web-of-Science,ImpactForceofaGeomorphicDamBreakWaveagainstanObstacleEffectsofSedimentInertia,[0.03219185769557953],[0.023153409361839294],[0.9989098310470581],[0.18293584883213043],[0.022264916449785233],[0.1579144448041916],[0.007907291874289513],[0.4233388304710388],[0.02398487739264965],[0.05712398141622543],[0.007475121412426233],[0.646460235118866]

The model consists of the Saint-Venant system governing the water flow coupled with the Exner equation for the sediment transport. One of the main difficulties in designing good numerical methods for such models is related to the fact that the speed of water surface gravity waves is typically much faster than the speed at which the changes in the bottom topography occur. This imposes a severe stability restriction on the size of time steps, which, in turn, leads to excessive numerical diffusion that affects the computed bottom structure. In order to overcome this difficulty, we develop an operator splitting approach for the underlying coupled system, which allows one to treat slow and fast waves in a different manner and using different time steps. Our method is based on the application of a finite-volume central-upwind scheme introduced in [A. Kurganov and G. Petrova, Commun. Math.

The SVE system (SVEs) under some considerations, is a nonconservative hyperbolic system of nonlinear partial differential equations. This model is widely used in coastal engineering to simulate the interaction of fluid flow with sediment beds. It is well known that SVEs requires a robust treatment of nonconservative terms. Some efficient numerical schemes have been proposed to overcome the difficulties related to these terms. However, the main drawbacks of these schemes are what follows: (i) Lack of robustness, (ii) Generation of non-physical diffusions, (iii) Presence of instabilities within numerical solutions. This collection of drawbacks weakens the efficiency of most numerical methods proposed in the literature. To overcome these drawbacks a reformulation of the central-upwind scheme for SVEs (CU-SVEs for short) in a path-conservative version is presented in this work. We first develop a finite-volume method of the first order and then extend it to the second order via the averaging essentially non oscillatory (AENO) framework.

The hydrodynamic model described by the Saint-Venant system is numerically solved using the well-balanced unstaggered central scheme proposed in Dong and Li (2020). The morphodynamic model described by the Exner equation is numerically solved by using a Lax-Friedrichs method. In solving the morphodynamic model, we proposed a novel “cut-off” function to guarantee the nonlinear stability and preserve the stationary solution. The present scheme can exactly obtain the stationary solution and is capable of guaranteeing the positivity of the water depth.

Here, we study the basic mechanism that governs the evolution of topographic and expansions and explore the instability of the bottom topography under conditions of steady but spatially expanding flow. We model the expanding flow via a by configuration where water and sediments are supplied from a central hole and flow on a cone shaped surface confined by lateral walls. The governing equations are the shallow-water equations coupled with the Exner equation, written in cylindrical coordinates. We initially approach the problem analytically by considering the conditions required for the basic state, consisting of a pure radial flow and bottom profile, to lose stability to small amplitude perturbations. This analysis suggests that more than one mode may be unstable, encouraging us to extend the analysis to the nonlinear regime. We do this through numerical modeling of the full governing equations, which allows us to predict the establishment of a bar pattern whose features are similar to those experimentally observed. Two prominent features of the finite-amplitude bar pattern are (1) bar apices are distributed at a radial distance from the inflow consistent with work of Shaw et al.

The near-bed transport region is represented by the lower (bedload) layer which has an arbitrarily constant, vanishing thickness (of approx. 10 times the sediment particle diameter), and whose average sediment concentration is free to vary. Sediment is allowed to enter the upper layer, and hence the total load may also be simulated, provided that concentrations of suspended sediment remain low. The model conforms with established theories of bedload, and is validated satisfactorily against empirical expressions for sediment transport rates and the morphodynamic experiment of a migrating mining pit by Lee et al.

The equations are written in terms of potential temperature and Exner function. The time stepping is accomplished with the EPI2 and EPI3 schemes which have been used in the past for very accurate, long time step integration of the shallow water equations on the sphere. The stability of exponential integrators of this class is ensured by approximation of the oscillatory term using an absolutely stable exponential formula. Consequently, the schemes are not subject to the CFL condition imposed by the linear oscillatory part of the system and they also eliminate the phase errors associated with all the known implicit time stepping algorithms. All calculations are performed using the phipm algorithm based on the Krylov space methods. It is shown that the spectral radius of the Jacobian and consequently the Krylov space dimension are very sensitive to the presence of spatial noise. Efficiency and accuracy increase after the Shapiro filter is applied every two time steps. The method is investigated using several standardized and well accepted benchmark tests, including convective bubbles and a cold density current proposed by Straka and collaborators. Numerical experiments show that a stable integration is obtained for the wave Courant number of the order of 60 to 250. We present a detailed discussion of the development of a cold density current capturing the spiraling Prandtl vortex and the subsequent appearance of the Kelvin-Helmholtz billows. Our results from the exponential method compare very well with those obtained from the accurate schemes reported in the recent literature. The algorithm accurately handles both advection as well as acoustic and gravity waves. These results warrant the further development of the scheme for modeling atmospheric processes on a wide range of scales.

Complex interactions between tides, waves and shallow bathymetry often drive fast morphological changes but the underlying processes remain only partly understood. To better understand these processes, the development and application of morphodynamic models represents a unique perspective. This paper evaluates the impact of recent developments in the modelling system SCHISM, which include: a WENO method to solve the Exner Equation, a 3D coupling between waves and currents using a vortex force formalism, an adaptive parameterization for the dissipation of short waves by breaking and improved representations for wave-induced sediment transport. In order to evaluate the relevance of these developments, SCHISM is applied to the Maumusson Inlet, a mixed-energy inlet located on the Western Coast of France. Model-data comparison reveals firstly that complex wave-current interactions take place over the inlet ebb-delta, that include partial wave blocking during the ebb. Compared to classical 2DH approaches, our improved modelling system better reproduces the dynamics of adjacent beaches, inlet migration under oblique waves and sediment infilling of the main channel under storm waves. The relevance of these developments is demonstrated at the mixed-energy Maumusson Inlet (France).",2020,2024-12-01 00:01:09,2024-12-01 00:01:09,,1016-1020,,95,,,,,,,,,,,English,,,,,,,"Place: 5130 NW 54TH STREET, COCONUT CREEK, FL 33073 USA Publisher: COASTAL EDUCATION & RESEARCH FOUNDATION Type: Article",,,,sediment transport; morphodynamic modelling; Tidal inlet; wave-current interactions,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Web-of-Science,RecentAdvancesinTidalInletMorphodynamicModelling,[0.026205414906144142],[0.3330150246620178],[0.021990222856402397],[0.25173965096473694],[0.19072403013706207],[0.14712579548358917],[0.09203286468982697],[0.027954399585723877],[0.008830246515572071],[0.9655439853668213],[0.005230277311056852],[0.7174575328826904]

The hydrodynamic model solves the three-dimensional shallow water equations (SWEs) using a finite volume method on prismatic cells in sigma-coordinates. The morphodynamic model solves an Exner equation consisting of bed-load sediment transportation. Using a relaxation approach, a hyperbolic system is built for hydrodynamic system, which allows for using a Godunov-type central-upwind method to capture the shocks and approximate the numerical fluxes. Consequently, the 3D-SWEs-Exner model proposed in the present study can stably and accurately solve the dam-break flows over mobile beds. A spatially and temporally second-order “prismatic” central-upwind method is used to approximate the numerical fluxes through cell interfaces. The Exner equation is solved using an upwind method. Using spatially linear reconstruction and explicit two-stage Runge-Kutta time discretization, second order accuracy is achieved in space and time. The proposed model can preserve the well-balanced property due to the special discretization of bed-slope source terms. The proposed model is validated by several tests with experimental measurements, and is compared with the simulated results using reported two-dimensional (2-D) models. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

To test these different approaches we use a suitable set of test cases. Three of them are presented here: a test with a smooth analytical solution, a Riemann problem with analytical solution and a test in which the Froude number approaches unity.

The transport of sediment by the flow assumes the sediment flux to remain in equilibrium with the local bed shear stress. Accordingly, the shallow-water hydrodynamic equations are coupled with the Exner equation for mass conservation of the sediment. The system of equations is solved using a fully coupled well-balanced finite volume method, second-order accurate in time and space. The effect of the steep bed slope of a dam face is incorporated into both the hydrodynamics and sediment transport equations, leading to improved predictions. Comparison with results obtained from nonequilibrium sediment transport models indicates that such models perform poorly while predicting the bed evolution near the toe of an eroding dam. Observations from experimental studies demonstrate that the amount of sediment entrained by the flow is not significant, except during the initial moments of failure. This suggests that the vertical exchange of mass between the bed and the flow layer, as assumed by the nonequilibrium models, may not be completely valid during the failure. The equilibrium model results, reproducing the key flow features of the overtopping failure process, are validated by experimental measurements. The study provides fresh insights into the sediment transport processes associated with the erosion of a granular dam by overtopping, establishes the appropriateness of the equilibrium approach for its numerical modeling, and proposes a well-balanced second-order accurate solution technique for solving the resulting coupled equations of flow and sediment transport.",2021-04,2024-12-01 00:01:09,2024-12-01 00:01:09,,,,4,33.0,,,,,,,,,,English,,,,,,,"Place: 1305 WALT WHITMAN RD, STE 300, MELVILLE, NY 11747-4501 USA Publisher: AMER INST PHYSICS Type: Article",,C:\Users\johan\Zotero\storage\5MY74M9U\Biswas et al. - 2021 - Equilibrium approach for modeling erosional failure of granular dams.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Web-of-Science,Equilibriumapproachformodelingerosionalfailureofgranulardams,[0.4783993363380432],[0.5249578952789307],[0.07640767097473145],[0.9838316440582275],[0.687839686870575],[0.17009402811527252],[0.1792430579662323],[0.2932526767253876],[0.02822098694741726],[0.21206879615783691],[0.004895881284028292],[0.8325772285461426]

The coupled method uses a coupling of the governing equations at the same time step leading to a non-conservative solution. The splitting method solves the Exner and the shallow water equations in a separate manner, and is only capable of modeling weak free-surface and bedload interactions. In the current study, an extended version of a Godunov-type wave propagation algorithm is presented for modeling of morphodynamic systems using both coupled and splitting approaches. In the introduced coupled method the entire morphodynamic system is solved in the form of a conservation law. For the splitting technique, a new wave Riemann decomposition is defined which enables the scheme to be utilized for mild and strong interactions. To consider the bedload sediment discharge within the Exner equation, the Smart and Meyer-Peter & Muller formulae are used. It was found that the coupled solution gives accurate predictions for all investigated flow regimes including propagation over a dry-state using a Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy (CFL) number equal to 0.6. Furthermore, the splitting method was able to model all flow regimes with a lower CFL number of 0.3.

The model is devised for compound channels modeling: cross-section overbanks are treated with fixed bed conditions, while the main channel is left free to modify its morphology. A capacitive approach is used for bed load transport modeling, in which the solid flow rates are estimated with bed load transport formulas. The model equations pose some numerical issues in the case of natural channels, where bed load transport may occur for both subcritical and supercritical flows and geometry varies in space. An explicit path-conservative scheme, designed to overcome all these issues, is presented in the paper. The scheme solves liquid and solid phases dynamics in a coupled manner, in order to correctly model near critical currents/channel interactions and is well-balanced, that is able to properly reproduce steady states. The Roe and Osher Riemann solvers are implemented, so as to take into account the spatial geometry variations of natural channels. The scheme reaches up to second-order accuracy.

Indeed, it induces a fast transient flow that may entrain large amounts of sediments and modify the valley morphology. The understanding of the interaction between such a rapid flow and the sediment transport remains a challenge for fluvial hydraulics. A combined approach of laboratory, theoretical and numerical modelling is still needed to predict the geomorphic consequences of a dam failure, mainly in a complex topography. A laboratory study of a dam-break wave expanding over a flat mobile bed in a floodplain was conducted in the Hydraulics Laboratory, Institute of Mechanics, Materials and Civil Engineering, Universite catholique de Louvain, Belgium. The flume was 3.6 m wide and about 36 m long. The rising gate featuring the dam break was 1 m wide, inducing a wave expanding longitudinally as well as transversally. An initial 85 mm layer of coarse sand was put down upon the fixed bed from 1 m upstream to 9 m downstream of the gate representing the dam. Two cases were simulated: (1) an initial water level of 47 cm above the fixed bed in the upstream reservoir and no water downstream; (2) an initial water level of 51 cm in the upstream reservoir and a water level of 15 cm downstream. Time evolution of the water level was measured at 8 points by means of ultrasonic gauges and the final topography was measured by a bed profiler every 5 cm. Only bed-load transport was observed in these experiments. This laboratory test was carried out as a benchmark experiment in NSF-Pire project (http://pire.ce.sc.edu/) and allowed two-dimensional (2D) numerical models from several authors to be analysed. Among these models, two shallow-water models are here compared in details. In the first model, a clear-water layer approach is used: the Saint-Venant-Exner (SVE) equations are solved, using a Manning formula for the friction source term and a Meyer-Peter-Muller closure equation based on an equilibrium solid transport assumption. The second model is a two-layer model (2L), where the flow is described along a vertical by three regions of homogeneous properties separated by sharp interfaces. The upper layer is made of clear water while the lower layer, standing for the bed-load transport layer, is a mixture of water and moving sediments. These layers flow over a motionless bed. Both models are solved on unstructured triangular meshes by a finite-volume scheme with a lateralized Harten-Lax-Van Leer (HLL) flux computation. Interesting conclusions may arise from comparisons between both models and comparisons with laboratory observations. The main features experimentally observed are captured by the numerical models. The water level evolution is better reproduced by the two-layer model than by the SVE model. The final deposition crests near the walls are still difficult to predict by both models.",2013,2024-12-01 00:01:09,2024-12-01 00:01:09,,4485-4494,,,,,,,,,,,TSINGHUA UNIV,"DEPT BUILDING SCI, SCH ARCHITECTURE, SECRETARIAT ISHVAC07, BEIJING, 100084, PEOPLES R CHINA",English,,,,,,,Backup Publisher: Minist Water Resources; China Inst Water Resources & Hydropower Res; Sichuan Univ; Tsinghua Univ; Univ Hong Kong; Chengdu Municipal Peoples Govt Type: Proceedings Paper,,,,Sediment transport; Finite volume; Dam-break flow; Mobile bed; 2D models,,"Zhaoyin, W; Lee, JHW; Jizhang, G; Shuyou, C",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Web-of-Science,2DDambreakFlowsoverErodibleFloodplainComparisonofTwoShallowwaterModelsagainstLaboratoryExperimentsaSaintVenantExnerClassicalApproachandaTwolayerDescription,[0.9937223196029663],[0.10329549014568329],[0.9831175208091736],[0.8467044830322266],[0.5880318284034729],[0.0892956405878067],[0.08897848427295685],[0.11153118312358856],[0.0028952136635780334],[0.0018639287445694208],[0.006326631642878056],[0.21068508923053741]

Then, the Exner equation is included to take into account bedload sediment transport. Finally, source terms for friction, erosion and deposition processes are considered. Indeed, observe that the sediment particle could go in suspension into the water or being deposited on the bottom. For the numerical scheme, we rely on well-balanced Lagrange-projection methods. In particular, since sediment transport is generally a slow process, we aim to develop semi-implicit schemes in order to obtain fast simulations. The Lagrange-projection splitting is well-suited for such a purpose as it entails a decomposition of the (fast) acoustic waves and the (slow) material waves of the model. Hence, in subsonic regimes, an implicit approximation of the acoustic equations allows us to neglect the corresponding CFL condition and to obtain fast numerical schemes with large time step.",2023-11,2024-12-01 00:01:09,2024-12-01 00:01:09,,1087-1126,,4,16.0,,,,,,,,,,English,,,,,,,"Place: Office B, 9/F, Kings Wing Plaza2, No.1 On Kwan St, Shek Mun, NT, Hong Kong, 00000, PEOPLES R CHINA Publisher: GLOBAL SCIENCE PRESS Type: Article",,C:\Users\johan\Zotero\storage\3V4SBL52\Del Grosso et al. - 2023 - On Lagrange-Projection Schemes for Shallow Water Flows Over Movable Bottom with Suspended and Bedloa.pdf,,Shallow water flows; erosion-deposition processes; implicit-explicit schemes; Lagrange-projection schemes; movable bottom,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Web-of-Science,OnLagrangeProjectionSchemesforShallowWaterFlowsOverMovableBottomwithSuspendedandBedloadTransport,[0.9566746950149536],[0.6331267952919006],[0.510080873966217],[0.1406310498714447],[0.38317957520484924],[0.1203354075551033],[0.9947391152381897],[0.014309454709291458],[0.008267597295343876],[0.06383160501718521],[0.0027629986871033907],[0.00483911857008934]

Especially in the context of climate change, these defense structures are more prone to extreme hydraulic loadings. Inundation hazard and risk map inherently depend on the dominant form of failure progression. Breaching of earthen dams or embankments is a complex phenomenon that relies on various characteristics such as constituted soil, hydraulic load, regular maintenance, etc.In the frame of the 6th workshop on River and Sedimentation Hydrodynamics and Morphodynamics, a blind benchmark test concerning progressive dam failure due to overtopping was offered to modelers in order to evaluate and calibrate their models. The present paper only reports about the simulations done at UCLouvain, during the blind phase of the benchmark test. Two depth-averaged finite-volume models were applied to this benchmark test. While the first model (WCM) decoupled the shallow-water equations from Exner's one, leaving only weak links between the different operators, the second one (CM) solved them altogether. The WCM was able to reproduce most of the reservoir's water level evolution and is hence supposed to rather accurately predict the evolution of the breach width. Conversely, the CM led to faster erosion of the dam than expected, which led to a rapid decrease of the reservoir's water level. Meanwhile, a bank-failure operator is necessary to reproduce properly the widening of the breach.

A linked simulation-optimisation model is proposed for this purpose. The morphological flow simulation model was developed by solving the shallow-water equations and the Exner sediment continuity equation in a boundary-fitted coordinate system. The optimisation model was developed utilising a binary-coded genetic algorithm. The proposed model can automatically provide a cost-effective groyne series in terms of their number, length and position in any vulnerable channel bend. A constraint in terms of bend scour is also incorporated in the optimisation model, which allows the optimisation model to obtain the best groyne combination for no bend scour. To appraise the performance of the model, it was applied to a hypothetical vulnerable channel bend. The model produced the minimised cost of installation of the groyne system at that location, at the same time as making the location free from bend scour.",2021-08,2024-12-01 00:01:09,2024-12-01 00:01:09,,198-211,,4,174.0,,,,,,,,,,English,,,,,,,"Place: HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND Publisher: EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD Type: Article",,C:\Users\johan\Zotero\storage\NCRZC2G3\Bora and Kalita - 2021 - Best groyne series as countermeasure against river bend scour.pdf,,river engineering; hydraulics & hydrodynamics; mathematical modelling,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Web-of-Science,Bestgroyneseriesascountermeasureagainstriverbendscour,[0.0574403777718544],[0.6187804341316223],[0.17809659242630005],[0.19667187333106995],[0.3139454126358032],[0.037151824682950974],[0.7925445437431335],[0.2779137194156647],[0.0286798644810915],[0.060252316296100616],[0.005752545781433582],[0.31869715452194214]

The pioneering study by Reynolds [1] showed that the standard Saint-Venant-Exner equations are unconditionally stable at subcritical Froude number. Hence, the use of depth averaged flow equations, which are commonly used by the hydraulic community, prevents the formation of bedforms as dunes. Recently, Ca (n) over tilde ada-Pereira & Bohorquez [2] have proposed a simple sediment transport formulation able to capture the formation of dune when coupled with the Saint-Venant equations. We replace the standard Exner equation with a non-equilibrium sediment transport equation that includes the following necessary ingredients: first, a phase shift in the particle entrainment rate; second, a particle diffusivity and an eddy viscosity. Subsequently, we solve the linear stability problem of an erodible-bed channel and show that the neutral curve properly captures the bed instability both in subcritical regime (i.e. dune) and supercritical flow (i.e. antidune and roll wave). Finally, we corroborate the capabilities of the model by means of non-linear numerical simulations which reproduce the growth of dune and antidune in agreement with experiments.",2018,2024-12-01 00:01:09,2024-12-01 00:01:09,,,,,40.0,,,,E3S Web of Conferences,,,,E D P SCIENCES,"17 AVE DU HOGGAR PARC D ACTIVITES COUTABOEUF BP 112, F-91944 CEDEX A, FRANCE",English,,,,,,,ISSN: 2267-1242 Type: Proceedings Paper,,C:\Users\johan\Zotero\storage\J78UG4Q7\Canada-Pereira and Bohorquez - 2018 - A simple non-equilibrium bedload transport equation for the formation of dune in a shallow-water flo.pdf,,,,"Paquier, A; Riviere, N",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Web-of-Science,Asimplenonequilibriumbedloadtransportequationfortheformationofduneinashallowwaterflowoveranerodiblebed,[0.47638171911239624],[0.18661333620548248],[0.2568786144256592],[0.19505687057971954],[0.12517227232456207],[0.20173455774784088],[0.024214550852775574],[0.249996155500412],[0.01824677549302578],[0.1678997427225113],[0.0007748163188807666],[0.5818971991539001]

The mathematical expression modeling the the hydrodynamic and morphodynamic components of the physical phenomenon are treated to deal with cross-section shape variations and empirical solid discharge estimations. The resulting coupled system of equations can be rewritten as a non conservative hyperbolic system with three moving waves and one stationary wave to account for the source terms discretization. But, even for the simplest solid transport models as the Grass law, to find a linearized Jacobian matrix of the system can be a challenge if one considers arbitrary shape channels. Moreover, the bottom channel slope variations depends on the erosion-deposition mechanism considered to update the channel cross-section profile. In this paper a numerical finite volume scheme is proposed, based on an augmented Roe solver (first order accurate in time and space) and dealing with solid transport flux variations caused by the channel geometry changes. Channel cross-section variations lead to the appearance of a new solid flux source term which should be discretized properly.

Several negative aspects related to the lack of sediment supply were observed downstream many dams and the artificial replenishment of sediment was applied as a method to restore natural morphological conditions. The replenishment technique may be seen as a pulse of sediments added to the channel. Once the pulse-like volume of sediments is added into the reach, it is seen like an alteration of the channel geometry producing cross section narrowing and flow acceleration lengthwise the river. The river geometry modification together with the water flow allow erosion and transportation of the replenished material. In this work, the response of the flow to the material added in the channel is studied by means of the 2D shallow water equations model in combination with the Exner equation for the sediment continuity equation. Computational outcomes are compared with experimental data obtained from several replenishment configurations studied in the laboratory. It is observed how the bed fining provokes a larger spread of the material without aggradation within the armored channel.",2016,2024-12-01 00:01:09,2024-12-01 00:01:09,,1314-1320,,,,,,,,,,,CRC PRESS-BALKEMA,"PO BOX 11320, LEIDEN, South Holland, NETHERLANDS",English,,,,,,,"Backup Publisher: Int Assoc Hydro Environm Engn & Res; IIHR Hydroscience & Engn; Natl Great Rivers Res & Educ Ctr Alton; NSF; Amer Soc Civil Engineers, Environm & Water Resources Inst; Amer Soc Civil Engineers; AGU; Ven Te Chow Hydrosystems Lab; Saint Louis Univ; Sequoia Sci Inc; Sontek Type: Proceedings Paper",,,,,,"Constantinescu, G; Garcia, M; Hanes, D",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Web-of-Science,Modelingsedimentpulsesonanarmoredchannel,[0.8224031329154968],[0.31153157353401184],[0.9839553833007812],[0.25902825593948364],[0.20521654188632965],[0.08985312283039093],[0.019475216045975685],[0.7653303146362305],[0.027195056900382042],[0.01061142049729824],[0.009394395165145397],[0.7371108531951904]

The modelling system comprises the shallow water equations for the hydrodynamic behaviour and the Exner equation for the morphodynamic variations. These two systems of equations are then solved using a modified Godunov-type wave propagation method based on the coupled strategy which solves the entire coupled system in a fully hyperbolic conservative form. To maintain the hyperbolicity of the system, a well-known Grass-type bedload transport model is employed. First, the model is used to simulate parabolic sediment layer transportation over a flat bed. Next, the propagation of a sediment hump with a defined subcritical initial condition is considered. It will be shown that the proposed model provides a very good agreement with analytical or reference solutions even for the Courant number relatively close to 1 for the given test cases.",2015,2024-12-01 00:01:09,2024-12-01 00:01:09,,1904-1910,,,,,,,,,,,IAHR-INT ASSOC HYDRO-ENVIRONMENT ENGINEERING RESEARCH,"PASEO BAJO VIRGEN DEL PUERTO 3, MADRID, 28005, SPAIN",English,,,,,,,"Backup Publisher: Int Assoc Hydro Environm Engn & Res; Boskalis; Van Oord; UNESCO IHE; Delft Univ Technol; Deltares; Minist Infrastructure & Environm, Rijkswaterstaat; Royal HaskoningDHV; ARCADIS; WItteveen Bos; AANDERAA; Prince Sultan Bin Abulaziz Int Prize Water Type: Proceedings Paper",,,,Shallow water equations; Bedload sediment transport; Conservative fluxes; Flux-wave Approach,,"Mynett, A",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Web-of-Science,NUMERICALMODELLINGOFBEDLOADSEDIMENTTRANSPORTDYNAMICSUSINGAMODIFIEDFLUXWAVEAPPROACH,[0.9996324181556702],[0.7300493717193604],[0.2079375833272934],[0.9995505213737488],[0.9000036716461182],[0.11581064760684967],[0.9863894581794739],[0.08961381763219833],[0.030014924705028534],[0.1883239895105362],[0.005511933472007513],[0.29777616262435913]

First, the Savage-Hutter model for aerial avalanches is presented. Two other models for partially fluidized avalanches are then described: one in which the velocities of both the fluid and the solid phases are assumed to be equal, and another one in which both velocities are unknowns of the system. Finally, a Savage-Hutter model for submarine avalanches is derived. The second part is devoted to non-newtonian models, namely viscoplastic fluids. Indeed, a one-phase viscoplastic model can also be used to simulate fluidized avalanches. A brief introduction to Rheology and plasticity is presented in order to explain the Herschel-Bulkley constitutive law.

A town (Sondrio) is present at the downstream end of the river. Flood hazard for Sondrio can be related either to flood events with significant sediment transport (because the in-town reach is a preferential location for aggradation processes with resulting increase of the water elevation) or to dambreak events (in case of collapse of a major landslide at relatively short distance upstream). Therefore, the manuscript explores the use of hydro-morphologic modelling to assess the level of hazard related with the scenarios for flood with intense sediment transport and for landslide and following dam-break wave. For the first scenario, a past event (flood of 1987) is considered, that has been already object of previous investigations. Propagation of the flood wave and resulting river morphologic changes are modelled using the coupled Saint-Venant and Exner equations. For the second scenario, different models are combined in an integrated process chain: available estimations of the landslide volume and models for dam breaching are used to create inflow conditions in terms of water and sediment discharge into the river, then the wave propagation is modelled again using the shallow-water, one-dimensional approach. For both scenarios, the analysis is devoted to assessing if these waves could be able to transport a significant amount of sediments to Sondrio, maximum elevation of the water surface and characterization of the time scales for the events. The role of analyses such as that presented here for territorial management and protection is discussed.",2014,2024-12-01 00:01:09,2024-12-01 00:01:09,,1603-1610,,,,,,,,,,,CRC PRESS-TAYLOR & FRANCIS GROUP,"6000 BROKEN SOUND PARKWAY NW, STE 300, BOCA RATON, FL 33487-2742 USA",English,,,,,,,"Backup Publisher: Swiss Fed Off Environm; BG Consulting Engineers; Hydro Exploitat SA; E dric ch; IM & IUB Engn; Basler & Hofmann; AquaVis Engn; Met Flow SA; Int Assoc Hydro Environm Engn & Res, Comm Fluvial Hydraul; Stucky; Groupe E; Patscheider Partner; HydroCosmos SA; Kissling Zbinden AG; Ribi SA; Poyry; Swiss Assoc Water Management; Ecole Polytechnique Federale Lausanne, Lab Hydraul Construct Type: Proceedings Paper",,,,,,"Schleiss, AJ; DeCesare, G; Franca, MJ; Pfister, M",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Web-of-Science,Hydromorphologicmodellingfordifferentcalamitousscenariosinamountainstream,[0.04418331757187843],[0.2463066726922989],[0.14749377965927124],[0.23031331598758698],[0.09594075381755829],[0.08733006566762924],[0.021105006337165833],[0.39828944206237793],[0.010550079867243767],[0.005641908850520849],[0.0017996543319895864],[0.05707139894366264]

We employ a 2-D numerical model based on the solution of the classical shallow water equations for the fluid phase coupled with the Exner equation and some semi empirical closure for the sediment transport rates. The model is applied to the case of a straight rectangular channel closed at the landward end and characterized by an initial plane bed, perturbed by randomly distributed disturbances of small amplitude. Numerical simulations have been performed for fixed values of the aspect ratio relatively close to the critical conditions of the linear theory. Preliminary results of our analysis show that bottom instability originates in the seaward part of the channel, giving rise to the formation of free alternate bars, with amplitudes decaying landward and wavelengths shorter than those predicted by the linear theory. Moreover, such features grow and migrate landward in time.",2008,2024-12-01 00:01:09,2024-12-01 00:01:09,,789-795,,,,,,,Proceedings and Monographs in Engineering Water and Earth Sciences,,,,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,"11 NEW FETTER LANE, LONDON EC4P 4EE, ENGLAND",English,,,,,,,Backup Publisher: IAHR Type: Proceedings Paper,,,,,,"DohmenJanssen, CM; Hulscher, SJMH",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Web-of-Science,Ontheformationandmigrationoffreebarsinfinitetidalchannels,[0.3446088433265686],[0.03554439917206764],[0.9987791776657104],[0.1711997240781784],[0.45222601294517517],[0.15234725177288055],[0.06960497051477432],[0.4001046121120453],[0.01250379253178835],[0.14110378921031952],[0.0016324890311807394],[0.12231338024139404]

When these cyclones come closer to a coast, the sea level rapidly rises in the near shore region, where, the strong cyclonic winds blow towards the coast. This combined phenomenon can persist for few hours to few days which often become most destructive force as experienced in the past. This natural phenomenon known as storm surge can neither be modified nor prevented and it causes irreparable damage to life and property. The prediction of the magnitude of such cyclonic storm surges helps us to alert the disaster management personnel to articulate their activities and help the people in the coastal cities and villages to take necessary precautions. Shallow Water Equations (SWE) are the basic framework on which many real time predictions and mitigations of the aforementioned extreme hydrodynamic events could be explained and various approaches exist for solution of SWEs, mostly depending on the requirement of the problem In this paper, a hybrid Finite Volume (FV) and Finite Element (FE) based solver, which can efficiently use the depth adaptive unstructured gridding, is developed. The hybrid solver, is set up to simulate the real-time storm surge of cyclone Amphan, a Super Cyclone (SC), which made landfall over West Bengal coast, along east coast of India, on 20th May 2020. This cyclone was categorized as Very Severe Cyclonic Storm (VSCS) with wind speed close to 45 m/sand a moving wind speed of 7.5m/s approximately. Initially the model is calibrated and validated for a typical bathystrophic storm tide case and the hydrodynamic parameters like wind friction, bottom friction and eddy viscosity coefficients are attunedt The wind stress component of the calibrated numerical model is integrated with a semi-empirical cyclone model that is capable of reproducing the characteristics of cyclone Amphan. Such idealized cyclonic winds are validated with the real-time measured wind data and the final set up is used to predict the surge. The predicted surge due to cyclone Amphan, has been compared with the field measurements and the accuracy of the hybrid SWE model is evaluated.",2021-09,2024-11-19 23:54:29,2024-12-01 00:14:00,,1-8,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,ISSN: 0197-7385,,C:\Users\johan\Zotero\storage\57Y6Z2HY\Saichenthur and Murali - 2021 - Prediction of storm surge due to Super Cyclone Amphan using a Hybrid Finite Volume and Finite Elemen.pdf,,SWE; calibration; Extraterrestrial measurements; hydrodynamic parameters; Predictive models; Real-time systems; semi-empirical cyclone model; storm surge; Storms; super cyclone Amphan; Tropical cyclones; validation; Wind; Wind speed; coast modeling; 2D,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,IEEE,PredictionofstormsurgeduetoSuperCycloneAmphanusingaHybridFiniteVolumeandFiniteElementbasedSWEsolver,[0.01260062400251627],[0.845496416091919],[0.02239282801747322],[0.8827314972877502],[0.57004714012146],[0.009878941811621189],[0.9788950085639954],[0.001622967072762549],[0.006513499189168215],[0.9932811260223389],[0.02280263602733612],[0.11407212167978287]

The correct drying of the beans is one of the measures to contain this loss. As the grain mass is a set of solid and empty spaces, its drying could be considered a problem of the coupled open-porous medium. In this paper, a mathematical and computer simulation model was proposed, which describes the convection in a free flow with a porous obstacle applied to the drying of the grain. A computational fluid dynamics scheme was implemented in FORTRAN using Finite Volume to simulate and compute the numerical solutions. The code is parallel implemented using OpenMP and OpenACC programming interfaces. As a result, there was a significant reduction in processing time in both cases. The total simulation time was eight times less for a multicore architecture (16 physical cores) and 17.3 times using a single GPU (Quadro M5000).",2022-03,2024-12-01 00:13:45,2024-12-01 00:13:45,,181-188,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,ISSN: 2377-5750,,,,Computational modeling; Crops; Graphics processing units; High Performance Computing; Loss measurement; Mixing Layer; Multicore processing; Numerical Application; OpenACC; OpenMP; Programming; Solids,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,IEEE,ParallelOpenMPandOpenACCMixingLayerSimulation,[0.009002835489809513],[0.9542227387428284],[0.1674908548593521],[0.963265061378479],[0.36455124616622925],[0.07204689085483551],[0.9781771898269653],[0.0015277629718184471],[0.009340024553239346],[0.0010063779773190618],[0.0572819709777832],[0.02585877664387226]

The modelling system consists of three coupled model components: (i) the shallow-water equations for the hydrodynamical model; (ii) a transport equation for the dispersion of suspended sediments; and (iii) an Exner equation for the morphodynamics. These coupled models form a hyperbolic system of conservation laws with source terms. The proposed finite-volume method consists of a predictor stage for the discretization of gradient terms and a corrector stage for the treatment of source terms. The gradient fluxes are discretized using a modified Roe's scheme using the sign of the Jacobian matrix in the coupled system. A well-balanced discretization is used for the treatment of source terms. In this paper, we also employ an adaptive procedure in the finite-volume method by monitoring the concentration of suspended sediments in the computational domain during its transport process. The method uses unstructured meshes and incorporates upwinded numerical fluxes and slope limiters to provide sharp resolution of steep sediment concentrations and bed load gradients that may form in the approximate solutions. Details are given on the implementation of the method, and numerical results are presented for two idealized test cases, which demonstrate the accuracy and robustness of the method and its applicability in predicting dam-break flows over erodible sediment beds. The method is also applied to a sediment transport problem in the Nador lagoon. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",2013,2024-11-21 21:06:47,2024-12-01 00:35:47,,967 – 993,,9.0,72.0,,,,,,,,,,English,,,,,,,Type: Article,,C:\Users\johan\Zotero\storage\6THLSF7D\Benkhaldoun et al. - 2013 - An unstructured finite-volume method for coupled models of suspended sediment and bed load transport.pdf,,Finite volume method; Sediment transport; Suspended sediments; SWE-Exner; finite-volume method; Bed-load transport; Shallow water equations; Unstructured grid; bed load transport; mesh adaptation; Nador lagoon; shallow-water equations; suspended sediment; unstructured grids; 2D; Numerical Method; FVM; Equations of motion; Hydraulics; Flow of water; Jacobian matrices; Numerical methods; Sedimentology; Lakes; Mesh adaptation,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,Anunstructuredfinitevolumemethodforcoupledmodelsofsuspendedsedimentandbedloadtransportinshallowwaterflows,[0.9943251609802246],[0.7616271376609802],[0.9978801608085632],[0.9997909665107727],[0.9207184314727783],[0.5586881637573242],[0.9997933506965637],[0.037785764783620834],[0.03488089144229889],[0.7992073893547058],[0.014785409905016422],[0.2119872272014618]

To solve the coupled bed-load sediment transport terms using a Godunov-type central-upwind method, a novel scheme to estimate the bed-load fluxes which can produce more accurate results than the previously reported coupled model is proposed using a pair of local wave speeds different from those used for the flow. The two-dimensional shallow water equations are used to solve the flow velocities and water depth. The bed level is solved by an Exner-based equation containing bed-load sediment transport as numerical flux terms and sediment entrainment and deposition as source terms. Analytical formulas to compute the eigenvalues of the Jacobian matrix are developed. The linear reconstruction of variables with a multi-dimensional slope limiter, and the second-order Runge-Kutta scheme are employed to achieve higher accuracy in space and time.

In this work, the numerical resolution has been implemented using improved and efficient versions of two different strategies for combining the hydrodynamical and morphodynamical components of the system. The first strategy is based on the full coupling of the flow and bedload transport equations (FCM), leading to a new formulation for the intercell numerical fluxes which includes the bed elevation into the resolution of the approximated local Riemann problem (RP) at the edges. The stability region of this method is controlled by the eigenvalues of the coupled Jacobian matrix at each intercell edge. On the second hand, an alternative decoupled strategy is considered based on solving independently the shallow water and the bed transport equations at each time step but controlling the stability region by means of an approximation of the coupled Jacobian matrix eigenvalues. This method, called approximate-coupled (ACM) allows simpler expressions for the numerical fluxes at the edges and ensures the stability of the scheme. Both strategies are based on the Finite Volume (FV) method using Roe's approach for the computation of the numerical fluxes between neighbouring cells and have been implemented into the same CPU-based numerical kernel in order to perform a realistic comparison of the range of applicability and computational efficiency. The ACM can only guarantee non-oscillatory results when the bed-flow interaction factor is small G≤O(10−3). If the interaction factor G is medium or high, G>O(10−2), the decoupled scheme loses its accuracy and robustness. Furthermore, for highly erosive flows the FCM scheme demonstrates to be more efficient in terms of computational effort than the ACM, one of the key points for large-scale and long-term bedload transport realistic applications. © 2021 The Author(s)",2021,2024-11-21 21:06:48,2024-12-01 00:02:07,,,,,153.0,,,,,,,,,,English,,,,,,,Publisher: Elsevier Ltd Type: Article,,C:\Users\johan\Zotero\storage\HH5F3YNA\Martínez-Aranda et al. - 2021 - Comparison of new efficient 2D models for the simulation of bedload transport using the augmented Ro.pdf,,Augmented Roe schemes; Bedload transport models; Efficiency and robustness; Hydro-morphodynamical coupled equations; Sediment transport; SWE-Exner; sediment transport; shallow-water equation; Bed-load transport; 2D; Numerical Method; FVM; ACM; FCM; bedload; Equations of motion; finite volume method; Jacobians; hydrodynamics; two-dimensional modeling; Jacobian matrices; morphodynamics; Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions; Numerical methods; Numerical flux; Augmented roe scheme; Bedload transport model; comparative study; Computational efficiency; Efficiency; efficiency measurement; erodibility; Hydro-morphodynamical coupled equation; Intercell; Stability regions; Transport equation,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,Comparisonofnewefficient2DmodelsforthesimulationofbedloadtransportusingtheaugmentedRoeapproach,[0.9988796710968018],[0.8580061793327332],[0.8891443610191345],[0.8806431889533997],[0.8054027557373047],[0.27033573389053345],[0.9974241256713867],[0.10105592757463455],[0.012383785098791122],[0.34312158823013306],[0.008299687877297401],[0.03753800690174103]

A novel approach is developed for the treatment of multiple sediment types in morphodynamics. The governing equations include the two-dimensional shallow water equations for hydrodynamics, an Exner-type equation for morphodynamics, a two-dimensional transport equation for the suspended sediments, and a set of empirical equations for entrainment and deposition. Multilayer sedimentary beds are formed of different erodible soils with sediment properties and new exchange conditions between the bed layers are developed for the model. The coupled equations yield a hyperbolic system of balance laws with source terms. As a numerical solver for the system, we implement a fast finite volume characteristics method. The numerical fluxes are reconstructed using the method of characteristics which employs projection techniques. The proposed finite volume solver is simple to implement, satisfies the conservation property and can be used for two-dimensional sediment transport problems in non-homogeneous isotropic beds without need of complicated three-dimensional equations. To assess the performance of the proposed models, we present numerical results for a wide variety of shallow water flows over sedimentary layers. Comparisons to experimental data for dam-break problems over movable beds are also included in this study. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.",2020,2024-11-21 21:06:48,2024-12-01 00:36:01,,474 – 497,,,88.0,,,,,,,,,,English,,,,,,,Publisher: Elsevier Inc.

In this article, previous work by the second author and several collaborators on the application and analysis of the DG method is extended to coupled shallow water/bed morphology dynamics, also called morphodynamics. Morphodynamic boundary value problems are used to simultaneously model shallow water hydrodynamics and sediment transport processes in estuarine and coastal systems. The governing equations of interest arise when the two-dimensional Saint-Venant equations are tightly coupled to the corresponding Exner equation. The tight coupling of these two processes presents numerous modeling and analytical challenges. The resulting nonlinear system is incompletely parabolic, and contains a nonconservative product. In this work, some of these analytical challenges are tackled by applying a local discontinuous Galerkin method to the morphodynamic system; the quantities of interest and their gradients are solved separately. A general, semidiscrete finite element formulation is presented, and after justifying some mild assumptions, a new a priori error estimate for the system is derived. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",2015,2024-11-21 21:06:48,2024-12-01 00:02:01,,397 – 421,,2.0,31.0,,,,,,,,,,English,,,,,,,Publisher: John Wiley and Sons Inc.

Simultaneous simulation of multiple physical processes requires a fully coupled system to achieve an accurate hydraulic and morphodynamical prediction. In this paper, we develop a high-order well-balanced finite-volume method for a new fully coupled two-dimensional hyperbolic system consisting of the shallow water equations with friction terms coupled with the equations modeling the sediment transport and bed evolution.The nonequilibrium sediment transport equation is used to predict the sediment concentration variation. Since bed-load, sediment entrainment and deposition have significant effects on the bed evolution, an Exner-based equation is adopted together with the Grass bed-load formula and sediment entrainment and deposition models to calculate the morphological process. The resulting 5. ×. 5 hyperbolic system of balance laws is numerically solved using a Godunov-type central-upwind scheme on a triangular grid. A computationally expensive process of finding all of the eigenvalues of the Jacobian matrices is avoided: The upper/lower bounds on the largest/smallest local speeds of propagation are estimated using the Lagrange theorem. A special discretization of the bed-slope term is proposed to guarantee the well-balanced property of the designed scheme. The proposed fully coupled model is verified on a number of numerical experiments. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.",2015,2024-11-21 21:06:48,2024-12-01 00:36:02,,202 – 218,,,300.0,,,,,,,,,,English,,,,,,,Publisher: Academic Press Inc.

The Exner equation is written assuming that bed load transport is governed by a power law of the flow velocity and by a flow/sediment interaction parameter variable in time and space.

Despite its limitations, the Saint-Venant-Exner system is still (and for sure for some years) widely used in industrial codes to model the bedload sediment transport. In practice, its numerical resolution is mostly handled by a splitting technique that allows a weak coupling between hydraulic and morphodynamic distinct softwares but may suffer from important stability issues. In recent works, many authors proposed alternative methods based on a strong coupling that cure this problem but are not so trivial to implement in an industrial context. In this work, we then pursue 2 objectives. First, we propose a very simple scheme based on an approximate Riemann solver, respecting the strong coupling framework, and we demonstrate its stability and accuracy through a number of numerical test cases. However, second, we reinterpret our scheme as a splitting technique and we extend the purpose to propose what should be the minimal coupling that ensures the stability of the global numerical process in industrial codes, at least, when dealing with collocated finite volume method. The resulting splitting method is, up to our knowledge, the only one for which stability properties are fully demonstrated.

The bed load transport rate is calculated as an exponential function of depth-averaged flow velocity. To formulate a Godunov-type cell-centered finite volume method, the 2D domain is discretized using Cartesian cells. The HLL approximate Riemann solver is adopted, and a linear reconstruction is implemented to obtain values of conservative variables at cell edges. The model is applied to the 1D and 2D test cases.

The shallow-water equations are solved first to calculate the full evolution of flow fields, and then the Exner equation is solved to model the morphodynamic response. The numerical method is based on a projection method, which consists in combining the momentum and continuity equations in order to establish a Poisson-type equation for water surface levels. The present formulation is identified as a semi-coupled approach because the projection method incorporates the change in the bed evolution in its approximation.

The physical problem is modeled through the shallow-water equations coupled with the Exner equation to describe the time evolution of the bed profile. The spatial discretization of the governing equations is carried out by a finite-volume method and a modified Roe scheme designed for non-conservative systems. As for the time advancing, starting from an explicit method, a linearized implicit scheme is generated, in which the flux Jacobian is computed through automatic differentiation. Second-order accuracy in space is then obtained through MUSCL reconstruction and in time through a backward differentiation formula associated with a defect-correction approach. The implicit time advancing is compared in terms of accuracy and computational time with the explicit approach for one-dimensional and two-dimensional sediment transport problems, characterized by different time scales for the evolution of the bed and of the water flow. It is shown that, whenever the use of large time steps is compatible with the capture of the water flow dynamics and of the bedload evolution, the implicit scheme is far more efficient than its explicit counterpart with a CPU reduction up to more than two orders of magnitude. This makes implicit time differencing an attractive option for complex real life applications in this area. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.",2012,2024-11-21 21:06:48,2024-12-01 00:02:18,,82 – 104,,,63.0,,,,,,,,,,English,,,,,,,Type: Article,,C:\Users\johan\Zotero\storage\DYVYV7VV\Bilanceri et al. - 2012 - Linearized implicit time advancing and defect correction applied to sediment transport simulations.pdf,,Finite volume method; Bed load; Sediment transport; Sedimentation; SWE-Exner; Shallow water equations; 2D; Numerical Method; FVM; Equations of motion; Hydraulics; Automatic differentiations; Backward differentiation formulae; Computational time; Defect correction; Defects; Different time scale; Explicit method; Flow of water; Governing equations; Implicit schemes; Jacobians; Linearization; Linearized implicit time advancing; Non conservative systems; Orders of magnitude; Real-life applications; Roe scheme; Second-order accuracy; Spatial discretizations; Time evolutions; Time step; Transport simulation; Water flows; Automatic differentiation,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,Linearizedimplicittimeadvancinganddefectcorrectionappliedtosedimenttransportsimulations,[0.7794897556304932],[0.8689380288124084],[0.8359527587890625],[0.7816641330718994],[0.8323729038238525],[0.7725306749343872],[0.9912378787994385],[0.003922447096556425],[0.004142016638070345],[0.0586685948073864],[0.017045317217707634],[0.18177099525928497]

Then the flux modelling has been deployed by the total variation diminishing (TVD) version of the weighted average flux (WAF) scheme.

This coupling can be done if using a suitable Jacobian matrix. As a result, faithful numerical predictions are available for a wide range of flow conditions and empirical bed load discharge formulations, allowing to investigate the best option in each case study, which is mandatory in these type of environmental problems. When coupling the equations, the SWE are considered but including an extra conservation law for the sediment dynamics. In this way the computational cost may become unrealistic in situations where the application of the SWE over rigid bed can be used involving large time and space scales without giving up to the adequate level of mesh refinement. Therefore, for restoring the numerical efficiency, the coupling technique is simplified, not decreasing the number of waves involved in the Riemann problem but simplifying their definitions. The effects of the approximations made are tested against experimental data which include transient problems over erodible bed. The simplified model is formulated under a general framework able to insert any desirable discharge solid load formula. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.",2014,2024-11-21 21:06:48,2024-12-01 00:35:43,,93 – 109,,,71.0,,,,,,,,,,English,,,,,,,Publisher: Elsevier Ltd Type: Review,,C:\Users\johan\Zotero\storage\5J5EN66L\Juez et al. - 2014 - A 2D weakly-coupled and efficient numerical model for transient shallow flow and movable bed.pdf,,Finite volume method; Bed load; Sediment transport; SWE-Exner; Bed load sediment transport; Exner equation; 2D shallow water; sediment transport; shallow-water equation; Shallow water equations; 2D; Numerical Method; FVM; bedload; Equations of motion; finite volume method; numerical model; two-dimensional flow; water flow; 2D shallow waters; Concrete placing; Coupling techniques; discharge; Environmental problems; flow modeling; Jacobian matrices; Numerical efficiency; Numerical predictions; spatiotemporal analysis,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,A2Dweaklycoupledandefficientnumericalmodelfortransientshallowflowandmovablebed,[0.888372004032135],[0.7938261032104492],[0.16715069115161896],[0.10941996425390244],[0.5719160437583923],[0.18198898434638977],[0.9608415961265564],[0.005070175044238567],[0.01032815221697092],[0.13632069528102875],[0.0035038229543715715],[0.6153479814529419]

The governing equations comprise the shallow water equations (SWEs) for the hydrodynamic phase and the Exner equation for the estimation of bedload sediment transport. These sets of equations are then solved using a weakly coupled scheme based on an augmented Riemann solver (WCAR). In this approach, first, the morphodynamic equation is solved, and then, updated bedload changes with the same Riemann structures are used as a source term within the SWEs. The Smart formula is utilized to estimate the bedload sediment discharge within the Exner equation. The proposed numerical model is first used to model a parabolic sediment layer. Then, a bedload hump propagation with an initial subcritical condition is considered. Next, the simulation of dam-break flow over a mobile bed is investigated. Finally, the dam failure due to over-topping is studied and the computed results are compared with available experimental data.

Considering the fact that well-proven capacity formulae are based on one-dimensional (1D) experimental steady flows, the assessment of these empirical relations under unsteady 1D and 2D situations is important. In order to ensure the reliability of the numerical experimentation, the formulation has to be general enough to allow the use of different empirical laws. Moreover, the numerical scheme must handle correctly the coupling between the 2D shallow-water equations and the Exner equation under any condition. In this work, a finite-volume numerical scheme that includes these two main features will be exploited here in 1D and 2D laboratory test cases. The relative performances of Meyer-Peter and Müller, Ashida and Michiue, Engelund and Fredsoe, Fernandez Luque and Van Beek, Parker, Smart, Nielsen, Wong and Camenen and Larson formulations are analysed in terms of the root mean square error.

The Harten–Lax–van Leer–Contact (HLLC) Riemann solver is extended to find the local Riemann fluxes to maintain the exact balance between the momentum term and the bed slope term. A well-balanced scheme is superior to an unbalanced scheme to minimize numerical dispersion as demonstrated by the synthetic standing contact-discontinuity test case. Following this, the model is employed to simulate two laboratory experiments and a field case, the 1996 Lake Ha! Ha! flood event in Canada.

Two different mathematical models were compared: a fully coupled formulation of shallow water equations with erosion and deposition terms (a depth-averaged concentration flux model), and shallow water equations with a fully coupled Exner equation (a bed load flux model). Both models were discretized using the cell-centered finite volume method, and a second-order Godunov-type scheme was used to solve the equations. The numerical flux was calculated using a Harten, Lax, and van Leer approximate Riemann solver with the contact wave restored (HLLC). A novel slope source term treatment that considers the density change was introduced to the depth-averaged concentration flux model to obtain higher-order accuracy. A source term that accounts for the sediment flux was added to the bed load flux model to reflect the influence of sediment movement on the momentum of the water. In a one-dimensional test case, a sensitivity study on different model parameters was carried out. For the depth-averaged concentration flux model, Manning's coefficient and sediment porosity values showed an almost linear relationship with the bottom change, and for the bed load flux model, the sediment porosity was identified as the most sensitive parameter. The capabilities and limitations of both model concepts are demonstrated in a benchmark experimental test case dealing with dam-break flow over variable bed topography. © 2017 Hohai University",2017,2024-11-21 21:06:48,2024-11-21 21:28:17,,287 – 294,,4.0,10.0,,,,,,,,,,English,,,,,,,Publisher: Editorial Office of Water Science and Engineering Type: Article,,C:\Users\johan\Zotero\storage\QW4DIUYQ\Zhao et al. - 2017 - Comparison of depth-averaged concentration and bed load flux sediment transport models of dam-break.pdf,,Finite volume method; Sediment transport; Sedimentation; Sediments; SWE-Exner; Shallow water equations; 2D; Numerical Method; FVM; Equations of motion; Shallow waters; Approximate Riemann solver; Computational fluid dynamics; Dam-breaks; Dams; Erosion and deposition; Flux model; Manning's coefficients; Porosity; Sediment transport model,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,Comparisonofdepthaveragedconcentrationandbedloadfluxsedimenttransportmodelsofdambreakflow,[0.14547918736934662],[0.8840392827987671],[0.008898884057998657],[0.8376863598823547],[0.5306469798088074],[0.2160942405462265],[0.6816207766532898],[0.026810195297002792],[0.01327388733625412],[0.2810601592063904],[0.015603533014655113],[0.5391499996185303]

We propose a fully coupled method to simulate motion of wave-current-seabed systems and associated multiphysics phenomena. The wave action equation, the shallow water equations, and the Exner equation are respectively used for wave, current, and seabed morphology, and the discretization is based on a second-order, flux-limiter, finite difference scheme previously developed for current-seabed systems. The proposed method is tested with analytical solutions, laboratory measurements, and numerical solutions obtained with other schemes.

It is already several years since the single-layered models have been used to model shallow water flows over erodible beds. Although such models present a real opportunity for shallow water flows over movable beds, this paper is the first to propose a multilayered solver for this class of flow problems. Design/methodology/approach: Multilayered beds formed with different erodible soils are considered in this study. The governing equations consist of the well-established shallow water equations for the flow, a transport equation for the suspended sediments, an Exner-type equation for the bed load and a set of empirical equations for erosion and deposition terms. For the numerical solution of the coupled system, the authors consider a non-homogeneous Riemann solver equipped with interface-tracking tools to resolve discontinuous soil properties in the multilayered bed. The solver consists of a predictor stage for the discretization of gradient terms and a corrector stage for the treatment of source terms. Findings: This paper reveals that modeling shallow water flows over multilayered sedimentary topography can be achieved by using a coupled system of partial differential equations governing sediment transport. The obtained results demonstrate that the proposed numerical model preserves the conservation property, and it provides accurate results, avoiding numerical oscillations and numerical dissipation in the approximated solutions. Originality/value: A novel implementation of sediment handling is presented where both averaged and separate values for sediment species are used to ensure speed and precision in the simulations. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.",2020,2024-11-21 21:06:48,2024-12-01 00:35:50,,401 – 429,,2.0,37.0,,,,,,,,,,English,,,,,,,Publisher: Emerald Group Holdings Ltd.

The complete system of equations is made up of the energy balance law and the Exner equations. The numerical solution for this complete system is done in a segregated manner. First, the hyperbolic part of the system of balance laws is solved using a finite volume scheme. Three ways to compute the numerical flux have been considered, the Q-scheme of van Leer, the HLLCS approximate Riemann solver, and the last one takes into account the presence of non-conservative products in the model. The discretisation of the source terms is carried out according to the numerical flux chosen. In the second stage, the bed conservation equation is solved by using the approximation computed for the system of balance laws. The numerical schemes have been validated making comparisons between the obtained numerical results and the experimental data for some physical experiments. The numerical results show a good agreement with the experimental data. © 2021, Shanghai University.",2023,2024-11-21 21:06:48,2024-12-01 00:02:25,,885 – 922,,2.0,5.0,,,,,,,,,,English,,,,,,,Publisher: Springer Type: Article,,C:\Users\johan\Zotero\storage\EAUV6ZWL\González-Aguirre et al. - 2023 - Numerical Simulation of Bed Load and Suspended Load Sediment Transport Using Well-Balanced Numerical.pdf,,Finite volume method; Bed load; Sediment transport; Sedimentation; Suspended sediments; Numerical models; SWE-Exner; Numerical simulation; Finite-volume method; 1D; Numerical Method; Model Information; Equations of motion; Numerical methods; Balance law; Complete system; Conservation equations; Numerical flux; Numerical results; Numerical scheme; Suspended loads; Well- balanced schemes; Suspended load; Well-balanced schemes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,NumericalSimulationofBedLoadandSuspendedLoadSedimentTransportUsingWellBalancedNumericalSchemes,[0.008124709129333496],[0.8166258335113525],[0.03149937838315964],[0.8438951373100281],[0.6551154255867004],[0.40718603134155273],[0.9318355917930603],[0.005448068957775831],[0.01186912227421999],[0.06773145496845245],[0.005968730431050062],[0.9086989164352417]

The bottom elevation change is evaluated using an excess shear-stress equation, which accounts for the hydrodynamic conditions and for the material characteristics. The proposed model modifies the local topography at runtime wherever the levee is overtopped without having to predefine the position and shape of the breach. The model is implemented in CUDA programming language, so that simulations can be run on graphics processing units, guaranteeing fast execution times even for high-resolution meshes and large domains. The validation is performed based on several experimental tests, and numerical predictions are in good agreement with the measurements. The strengths and weaknesses of the proposed approach are also discussed by comparison with a sediment transport model based on the Exner equation: While the latter gives good results only for breaches forming in levees built with noncohesive material, the proposed model can also be applied to cohesive embankments. The application to a historical flood event is also presented, showing that the model can effectively be employed for real field simulations also in the case of multiple breaches.",2019-01,2024-11-21 21:26:47,2024-12-01 00:02:17,,682-702,,1.0,55.0,,,,,,,,,,English,,,,,,,"Place: 2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA Publisher: AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION Type: Article",,C:\Users\johan\Zotero\storage\HBXJDIIM\Dazzi et al. - 2019 - Integration of a Levee Breach Erosion Model in a GPU-Accelerated 2D Shallow Water Equations Code.pdf,,Finite volume method; Sediment transport; SWE-Exner; shallow water equations; erosion; finite volume; flood simulation; GPU; levee breach; sediment transport; shallow-water equation; 2D shallow water equations; Shallow water equations; 2D; CUDA; Numerical Method; FVM; experimental study; Equations of motion; finite volume method; Floods; Two-dimensional shallow water equations; flood; Sediment transport model; Computer graphics; computer simulation; Embankments; Erosion; Flood simulation; Graphics processing unit; hardware; historical perspective; levee; Levee breaches; Levees; Material characteristics; Physically-based erosion model; Program processors; Shear stress; software; topography,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,IntegrationofaLeveeBreachErosionModelinaGPUAccelerated2DShallowWaterEquationsCode,[0.09293445944786072],[0.9891396760940552],[0.9967013597488403],[0.22875899076461792],[0.8396682143211365],[0.14396822452545166],[0.9675331711769104],[0.18787656724452972],[0.01764446496963501],[0.006513497792184353],[0.013171950355172157],[0.952308714389801]

The mathematical expressions modeling the hydrodynamic and morphodynamic components of the physical phenomenon are treated to deal with cross-section shape variations and empirical solid discharge estimations. The resulting coupled equations can be rewritten as a non-conservative hyperbolic system with three moving waves and one stationary wave to account for the source terms discretization. Moreover, the wave celerities for the coupled morpho-hydrodyamical system depend on the erosion-deposition mechanism selected to update the channel cross-section profile. This influence is incorporated into the system solution by means of a new parameter related to the channel bottom variation celerity. Special interest is put to show that, even for the simplest solid transport models as the Grass law, to find a linearized Jacobian matrix of the system can be a challenge in presence of arbitrary shape channels. In this paper a numerical finite volume scheme is proposed, based on an augmented Roe solver, first order accurate in time and space, dealing with solid transport flux variations caused by the channel geometry changes. Channel cross-section variations lead to the appearance of a new solid flux source term which should be discretized properly. The stability region is controlled by wave celerities together with a proper reconstruction of the approximate local Riemann problem solution, enforcing positive values for the intermediate states of the conserved variables. Comparison of the numerical results for several analytical and experimental cases demonstrates the effectiveness, exact well-balancedness and accuracy of the scheme. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.
