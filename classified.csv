There is a wide range of physical situations of environmental interest, such as flow in open channels and rivers, tsunami and flood modelling, that can be mathematically represented by first-order non-linear systems of partial differential equations, whose derivation involves an assumption of the shallow water type. Shallow water models may include more sophisticated terms when applied to cases of not pure water floods, such as mud/debris floods, produced by landslides. Mud/debris floods are unsteady flow phenomena in which the flow changes rapidly, and the properties of the moving fluid mixture include stop and go mechanisms. The present work reports on a numerical model able to solve the 2D shallow water equations even including bed load transport over erodible bed in realistic situations involving transient flow and movable flow boundaries. The novelty is that it offers accurate and stable results in realistic problems since an appropriate discretization of the governing equations is performed. Furthermore, the present work is focused on the importance of the computational cost. Usually, the main drawback is the high computational effort required for obtaining accurate numerical solutions due to the high number of cells involved in realistic cases. However, the proposed model is able to reduce computer times by orders of magnitude making 2D applications competitive and practical for operational flood prediction. Moreover our results show that high performance code development can take advantage of general purpose and inexpensive Graphical Processing Units, allowing to run almost 100 times faster than old generation codes in some cases.",2019,2024-11-15 19:42:33,2024-12-03 02:47:53,,1235–1252,,,19,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Publisher: Springer,,C:\Users\johan\Zotero\storage\J3TCMUYG\García-Navarro et al. - 2019 - The shallow water equations and their application to realistic cases.pdf,,2D; Finite volumes; GPU; HPC; Numerical Method; River flows; SWE-Exner; Unsteady shallow flows; Validation Methods; Wetting/drying fronts,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Google-Scholar,theshallowwaterequationsandtheirapplicationtorealisticcases,0.9900888204574585,0.6119639873504639,0.9764332175254822,0.7740310430526733,0.31959202885627747,0.3129311203956604,0.9962661862373352,0.012475726194679737,0.03381756693124771,0.15714891254901886,0.06583498418331146,0.13472265005111694,0.38095706701278687,0.9428199529647827,0.3621141314506531,0.6155470609664917,0.08830808103084564,0.9487826824188232,0.909755289554596,0.4253274202346802,0.5236196517944336,0.3571222722530365,0.9395815134048462,0.049912191927433014,0.9355234503746033,0.8869600296020508,0.029901403933763504,0.044722575694322586,0.9992175698280334,0.021044565364718437,0.09195129573345184,0.02843603491783142,0.21280404925346375,0.7892336845397949,0.6886777877807617,0.9989433288574219,0.016737205907702446,0.9732915163040161,0.018653521314263344,0.7019174695014954,0.8001459836959839,0.18162579834461212,0.09359511733055115,0.21264047920703888

In the first part, we analyze the mathematical properties and the applications of the staggered grid scheme. The robustness of this scheme is validated on various applications such as the rotating shallow water equations for geostrophic flows model and viscous shallow water equations. In the second part, we consider some related models. Firstly focusing on the coupling between the Exner equation and the shallow water equations, modelling bedload sediment transport, we observe in a particular case the numerical convergence of the scheme to the exact solution, as well as a good agreement with the experimental data in the dam-break with erodible bottom test. Secondly, we present a numerical scheme based on the finite volume collocated scheme (HLLC) in order to approximate the Richard-Gavrilyuk model. This model is an extension of the shallow water model, fit for modelling the shear shallow water flows. Some numerical tests provide a validation of the scheme",2015,2024-11-15 19:42:33,2024-12-03 02:47:50,,,,,,,,,,,,,Université Paris-Est,,,,PhD Thesis,,,,,,,C:\Users\johan\Zotero\storage\QKWFDE7Y\Gunawan - 2015 - Numerical simulation of shallow water equations and related models.pdf,,2D; Numerical Method; SWE-Exner,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Google-Scholar,numericalsimulationofshallowwaterequationsandrelatedmodels,0.9949062466621399,0.20705735683441162,0.13217905163764954,0.14175429940223694,0.08438457548618317,0.11168525367975235,0.06897938996553421,0.032744280993938446,0.0881110280752182,0.0062321084551513195,0.9800569415092468,0.17314085364341736,0.0901084616780281,0.9799851775169373,0.04036635905504227,0.6369725465774536,0.19240131974220276,0.782555341720581,0.9960975646972656,0.388914555311203,0.12320727854967117,0.08214892446994781,0.9153560400009155,0.15533456206321716,0.387661337852478,0.013480103574693203,0.010944576933979988,0.03299238160252571,0.39940160512924194,0.07668380439281464,0.46692919731140137,0.04196977615356445,0.7766229510307312,0.6578682065010071,0.49444225430488586,0.9728307127952576,0.015101649798452854,0.22076214849948883,0.058614686131477356,0.03750273585319519,0.9449947476387024,0.2146914154291153,0.1030244380235672,0.20252203941345215

There is a wide range of physical situations in which these shallow-type formulations are applicable, such as open channels and rivers, tsunamis, floods, landslides or muddy slurries. Their numerical solution on the finite volume framework is governed by the dynamical properties of the flow, the uneven distribution of the bed level and also by the computational grid choice. The unified discretization of spatial flux derivatives and source terms has proven useful to ensure the properties of monotonicity, stability and conservation in the numerical solution. Surface shallow flows that occur in catchments and coasts usually require large space resolution over longer periods of time. The increasing complexity of the mathematical models, the advancements in numerical methods, as well as the increasing power of computation are making possible the physically-based simulation of these phenomena. The necessity of spatial resolution involves the use of a large number of elements, which increases the computational time when simulating realistic scenarios for a long time period. The resulting approach from the proper mathematical formulation, robust numerical resolution and efficient computational implementation of models (EST) can be very useful in the simulation of environmental surface processes with realistic temporal and spatial scales.",2022,2024-11-15 19:42:34,2024-11-24 04:24:49,,67–137,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Recommendations,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Google-Scholar,finitevolumemodelsandefficientsimulationtoolsestforshallowflows,0.6045808792114258,0.7140492796897888,0.7166483998298645,0.22058625519275665,0.42337483167648315,0.34533485770225525,0.059439342468976974,0.04288771003484726,0.011115551926195621,0.025112628936767578,0.9708502888679504,0.5420159697532654,0.4665575623512268,0.8806222677230835,0.6938682794570923,0.502124547958374,0.4359839856624603,0.5745529532432556,0.827457845211029,0.45826801657676697,0.45982760190963745,0.35227856040000916,0.02498779445886612,0.033621225506067276,0.6226027607917786,0.02391638606786728,0.009232215583324432,0.007591942325234413,0.34037551283836365,0.010288301855325699,0.06301946938037872,0.03138042986392975,0.9442282915115356,0.22312304377555847,0.035948317497968674,0.6682851910591125,0.061989448964595795,0.9401885271072388,0.03843008726835251,0.0063635739497840405,0.5581765174865723,0.14235107600688934,0.10141132771968842,0.17773951590061188

An efficient and properly calibrated computational model represents a useful tool to provide insight into the catchment dynamics at hydrological and geomorphological levels. In addition, it allows to develop detailed risk management and conservation plans. The challenge of finding a compromise between computational time and level of accuracy and robustness has traditionally expanded the use of simplified models (2D) rather than full three-dimensional models for flood simulation. This work presents a GPU accelerated 2D shallow-water model for the simulation of flood events over non-erodible and erodible bed in real time. In particular, an explicit first-order finite volume scheme is detailed to control the numerical instabilities that are likely to appear when used in complex topography. The model is applied to reproduce real events in a reach of the Ebro River (Spain) and the Cinca River (Spain) in order to compare the simulation results with the field data in a large domain and long flood duration allowing an analysis of the performance and speed-up achieved by different GPU devices. The high values of fit between observed and simulated results as well as the computational times achieved are encouraging to propose the use of the model as forecasting system. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.",2024,2024-11-21 20:41:52,2024-12-01 00:37:45,,151-166,,,Part F2923,,,,,,,,,,English,,,,,,,Publisher: Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH,,,,SWE-Exner; GPU; 2D; CUDA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Google-Scholar,shallowwaterflowsimulationfrommathematicstoreality,0.2654326856136322,0.3776998221874237,0.9976056814193726,0.997222363948822,0.26671302318573,0.1777980625629425,0.996849536895752,0.012346078641712666,0.0688132792711258,0.05595529451966286,0.8400170207023621,0.3533928692340851,0.4247075021266937,0.96738600730896,0.6920692920684814,0.9324811697006226,0.00628660386428237,0.5102428197860718,0.918641984462738,0.619025707244873,0.5843676924705505,0.3568390905857086,0.07483762502670288,0.00999422650784254,0.9974291324615479,0.9980505704879761,0.04885777831077576,0.016673045232892036,0.9967077374458313,0.0068107303231954575,0.5880022644996643,0.04569203779101372,0.9696707129478455,0.5018806457519531,0.03517797961831093,0.9972476959228516,0.26497605443000793,0.9843964576721191,0.007093861699104309,0.030014926567673683,0.968171238899231,0.13392412662506104,0.026380417868494987,0.20633374154567719

The continuous gain in computational power and the development of novel numerical algorithms, facilitated the wide application of shallow water models for river flow simulation. Despite the technological and numerical advances, the computational effort required by two-dimensional shallow water river models can still range from days to weeks for, e.g., large-scale simulations or when morphodynamic studies are included. In this context, we developed and implemented the new version 3 of the freeware BASEMENT, a two-dimensional numerical simulation tool, adopting a flexible software framework for different target platforms such as multi-core CPUs or graphics processing units (GPUs). This allows for simulation speedup of a multiple of ten, depending on the problem at hand and the final target platform. Besides the hydrodynamic module, the new software includes a module for morphodynamics accounting for lateral bed slope and curvature effects.

This article reviews and presents a taxonomy of braided river morphodynamic models and discusses the challenges facing model development and use, illustrating these challenges with a case example. The taxonomy is contextualised by an initial discussion of the physical mechanisms of braiding. The taxonomy differentiates between reach-scale and catchment-scale models. Reach-scale models are usually physics-based, which are further divided based upon the mathematical approach used to solve equations (analytical or numerical) and their dimensionality (1D, 2D or 3D). Cellular automata models are one type of numerical model that replace at least some physical processes with expedient rules. A 2D physics-based approach encapsulates sufficient process complexity to provide behavioural predictions. Predictions from catchment-scale landscape evolution models have potential for providing boundary conditions. Future progress in physics-based modelling needs to address three challenges: (i) representation of flow and sediment transport; (ii) temporal and spatial scaling; and (iii) model calibration, sensitivity, uncertainty and validation. The key problem for addressing these is the dearth of laboratory or natural experiment datasets. To show that progress can be made by comparing reach-scale predictions to high-resolution observations, a case study of monitoring and modelling, conducted in the Rees River, New Zealand, is presented. Hydraulic predictions of cellular automata and shallow water equation (Delft3d) models are compared to observed inundation extent. The efficacy of high-resolution, multi-temporal morphological data for assessing 2D physics-based morphodynamic model predictions is also demonstrated. © 2016 The Author(s) Geography Compass © 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",2016,2024-11-21 20:41:53,2024-11-21 21:49:22,,102-127,,3,10,,,,,,,,,,English,,,,,,,Publisher: Blackwell Publishing,,C:\Users\johan\Zotero\storage\6GJCF9AK\Williams et al. - 2016 - Numerical Modelling of Braided River Morphodynamics Review and Future Challenges.pdf,,sediment transport; shallow-water equation; Review; Recommendations; numerical model; morphodynamics; computer simulation; boundary condition; braided river; catchment; cellular automaton; fluvial geomorphology; New Zealand; Otago; Rees River; South Island,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Google-Scholar,numericalmodellingofbraidedrivermorphodynamicsreviewandfuturechallenges,0.10859927535057068,0.22110183537006378,0.1982806771993637,0.32238051295280457,0.5055962800979614,0.47140422463417053,0.7032570838928223,0.04776935651898384,0.039689403027296066,0.05899573117494583,0.057854633778333664,0.15528596937656403,0.42970818281173706,0.8457875847816467,0.5136345624923706,0.0596034936606884,0.001612414256669581,0.04005134105682373,0.8270506858825684,0.33231624960899353,0.20461906492710114,0.13571639358997345,0.016947424039244652,0.04590541869401932,0.0534033365547657,0.0041743675246834755,0.011642225086688995,0.007489624433219433,0.9658029079437256,0.015967655926942825,0.13753245770931244,0.07133200019598007,0.09653531014919281,0.04917643591761589,0.05208601802587509,0.9457511901855469,0.0427621491253376,0.03782128542661667,0.0063021220266819,0.005831270944327116,0.1212688684463501,0.05845324695110321,0.06273176521062851,0.12543988227844238

The coupled system of hydrodynamic and morphodynamic equations is solved by finite volume method using Godunov scheme. Roe's approximate Riemann solver is used to calculate the inviscid fluxes. The use of unstructured mesh makes the model applicable to complex domains. However, it is difficult to evaluate the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the Jacobian matrix in the global coordinate. The method proposed herein to deal with this difficulty is to transform the system into the local coordinate with one of the axes in the same direction as the interface outward normal vector. In the local coordinate system, the Jacobian matrix is simplified and the eigenvalues are analyzed using asymptotic method. Regular expansion breaks down when the flow is near critical. Uniformity of the expansion is achieved by changing the scales. Rotational invariance theorem is used to relate the interfacial fluxes in the global and local coordinate systems. Special treatment of the source term on unstructured grid makes the scheme stable and physically balanced (both mass and momentum). The method proposed in this paper for the eigen-system is very efficient comparing to iterative numerical methods. Results from the test cases show good agreement with the experiments. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

8,22,23,NET69L49,journalArticle,2010,"Ancey, Christophe",Stochastic modeling in sediment dynamics: Exner equation for planar bed incipient bed load transport conditions,Journal of Geophysical Research: Earth Surface,,,10.1029/2009JF001260,,"Even under flow equilibrium conditions, river bed topography continuously evolves with time, producing trains of irregular bed forms. The idea has recently emerged that the variability in the bed form geometry results from some randomness in sediment flux. In this paper, we address this issue by using the Exner equation and a population exchange model derived in an earlier paper. In this model, particle entrainment and deposition are idealized as population exchanges between the stream and the bed, which makes it possible to use birth-death Markov process theory to track the number of moving grains. The paper focuses on nascent bed forms on initially planar beds, a situation in which the coupling between the stream and bed is weak. In a steady state, the number of moving particles follows a negative binomial distribution. Although this probability distribution does not enter the family of heavy-tailed distributions, it may give rise to large and frequent fluctuations because the standard deviation can be much larger than the mean, a feature that is not accounted for with classic probability laws (e.g., Hamamori's law) used so far for describing bed load fluctuations. In the large-system limit, the master equation of the birth-death Markov process can be transformed into a Fokker-Planck equation. This transformation is used here to show that the number of moving particles can be described as an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process. An important consequence is that in the long term, the number of moving particles follows a Gaussian distribution. Laboratory experiments show that this approximation is correct when the mean number per unit length of stream, equation image/L, is sufficiently large (typically two particles per centimeter in our experiments). The particle number fluctuations give rise to bed elevation fluctuations, whose spectrum falls off like ω−2 in the high-frequency regime (with ω the angular frequency) and variance grows linearly with time. These features are in agreement with recent observations on bed form development (in particular, ripple growth).",2010,2024-11-21 21:48:33,2024-12-03 02:47:52,,,,F2,115,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Publisher: Wiley Online Library,,C:\Users\johan\Zotero\storage\MX45XET7\Ancey - 2010 - Stochastic modeling in sediment dynamics Exner equation for planar bed incipient bed load transport.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Google-Scholar,stochasticmodelinginsedimentdynamicsexnerequationforplanarbedincipientbedloadtransportconditions,0.7806986570358276,0.3582381308078766,0.3042525053024292,0.3381212055683136,0.15377260744571686,0.40011516213417053,0.2099970132112503,0.1307358294725418,0.005116727203130722,0.4285832941532135,0.01761573553085327,0.03915109857916832,0.10927236080169678,0.4979923367500305,0.988135576248169,0.7076032757759094,0.034269724041223526,0.34106335043907166,0.7010036110877991,0.39280223846435547,0.26961156725883484,0.10377237200737,0.6873677372932434,0.8394709229469299,0.030128860846161842,0.005708033684641123,0.04795810207724571,0.0037072531413286924,0.5221906900405884,0.033211175352334976,0.02029348351061344,0.8116013407707214,0.12158143520355225,0.028707077726721764,0.060086652636528015,0.026056306436657906,0.8124957084655762,0.3925114572048187,0.0036358085926622152,0.0022126969415694475,0.22126655280590057,0.1578495353460312,0.086941659450531,0.2012632042169571

This model has proved useful, in particular through numerical simulations, for hydraulic engineering purposes (like estimating the mass of sediments that is drained through an open dam). Though, the model is also coarse. And its applicability at various space and time scales remains a question of considerable interest for sedimentologists. In particular, physical experiments from the grain scale to the laboratory scale reveal important fluctuations of the solid flux in given hydrodynamical conditions. This work is a preliminary study of the coupling of a stochastic Exner equation with a hydrody-namical model for large scales. (Stochastic models with a probabilistic solid flux are currently being investigated, but most often only from the viewpoint of theoretical physics at the grain scale.) We introduce a new stochastic Exner model and discuss it using numerical simulations in an appropriate test case.",2015,2024-11-21 21:48:33,2024-12-03 02:47:50,,321–340,,,48,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Publisher: EDP Sciences,,C:\Users\johan\Zotero\storage\DG7EKYX2\Audusse et al. - 2015 - Numerical simulation of the dynamics of sedimentary river beds with a stochastic Exner equation.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Google-Scholar,numericalsimulationofthedynamicsofsedimentaryriverbedswithastochasticexnerequation,0.7925935983657837,0.5660575032234192,0.33370327949523926,0.20860451459884644,0.3920171856880188,0.3239046037197113,0.12238287925720215,0.07434719800949097,0.021382831037044525,0.8756913542747498,0.02118697762489319,0.07394476234912872,0.19471198320388794,0.9136515855789185,0.3916964530944824,0.7852317690849304,0.01303255558013916,0.5005978941917419,0.7001915574073792,0.39762869477272034,0.2430477887392044,0.15558667480945587,0.9269014596939087,0.3282064199447632,0.03458621725440025,0.003824483836069703,0.002969444962218404,0.004239825531840324,0.5215978026390076,0.11114469915628433,0.022955456748604774,0.8537299633026123,0.05023735761642456,0.013454155996441841,0.024798158556222916,0.11284427344799042,0.11889567226171494,0.8884688019752502,0.002269468503072858,0.0060503981076180935,0.2930503189563751,0.11004006117582321,0.05654813349246979,0.129733145236969

In his work, Exner presents a simplified bed evolution model derived from the conservation of fluid mass and an “erosion” equation that is commonly referred to as the sediment continuity or Exner equation. Given that Exner’s model takes the form of a nonlinear hyperbolic equation, one expects, depending on the given initial condition of the bed, the formation of discontinuities in the solution in finite time. The analytical solution provided by Exner for his model is the so-called classical or genuine solution of the initial-value problem, which is valid while the solution is continuous.

The mathematical expression modeling the the hydrodynamic and morphodynamic components of the physical phenomenon are treated to deal with cross-section shape variations and empirical solid discharge estimations. The resulting coupled system of equations can be rewritten as a nonconservative hyperbolic system with three moving waves and one stationary wave to account for the source terms discretization. But, even for the simplest solid transport models as the Grass law, to find a linearized Jacobian matrix of the system can be a challenge if one considers arbitrary shape channels. Moreover, the bottom channel slope variations depends on the erosion-deposition mechanism considered to update the channel cross-section profile. In this paper a numerical finite volume scheme is proposed, based on an augmented Roe solver (first order accurate in time and space) and dealing with solid transport flux variations caused by the channel geometry changes. Channel crosssection variations lead to the appearance of a new solid flux source term which should be discretized properly. Comparison of the numerical results for several analytical and experimental cases demonstrate the effectiveness, exact wellbalanceness and accuracy of the scheme.",2018,2024-12-01 00:35:32,2024-12-03 02:47:45,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Issue: ART-2018-108658,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Google-Scholar,coupledmethodforthenumericalsimulationof1dshallowwaterandexnertransportequationsinchannelswithvariablecrosssection,0.023455748334527016,0.26958611607551575,0.5765463709831238,0.30953311920166016,0.12311135232448578,0.34878453612327576,0.002650868846103549,0.9997264742851257,0.008678913116455078,0.1251130998134613,0.9865880012512207,0.2004435807466507,0.37247297167778015,0.9855202436447144,0.07037807255983353,0.971895694732666,0.5956361293792725,0.6185579895973206,0.9882800579071045,0.5619643330574036,0.416268527507782,0.06396260857582092,0.063482366502285,0.08100937306880951,0.631367027759552,0.0124556515365839,0.011574994772672653,0.020685458555817604,0.014392336830496788,0.9978384375572205,0.18646511435508728,0.03541073575615883,0.9996273517608643,0.8090497851371765,0.09653531014919281,0.992864727973938,0.029507357627153397,0.262794554233551,0.13347168266773224,0.01304561272263527,0.9254997372627258,0.20729495584964752,0.04935939982533455,0.3496992886066437

15,36,37,PKXPPZ5M,conferencePaper,2014,"VALIANI, Alessandro; CALEFFI, Valerio; others",Some results on the numerical treatment of Movable Bed Shallow Water Equations,ECMI 2014 The 18th European Conference of Mathematics for Industry,,,,,"In this work a preliminary analysis is carried out, concerning the numerical integration of shallow water equations on movable bed. The fundamental aim is to understand if it is possible to capture the main features of some typical meso-scale bedforms, namely river dunes and/or antidunes, through a depth averaged approach, avoiding the numerical integration of full Navier-Stokes Equations by means of RANS or LES approach. The analysis regards the typical range of fluvial hydraulics, that is low sediment transport rate and negligible collisional effects between solid grains. The governing equations are the mass and momentum balance in the shallow water frame and the Exner equation for the bed elevation. Some classical results, considered as stated by the literature on this topic, are taken into account, namely the effects of the skin fiction and of the local bottom slope on the sediment mobility, the key parameter to evaluate the bed load transport. A source of uncertainties is the separation between the form drag effect and the skin friction effect in evaluating the total friction in a bedform-covered alluvial bottom. In order to separate such effects, we remove the average longitudinal bed slope from the momentum equation, and it is idealized as the external forcing which establishes the average mean flow in the considered domain. Firstly, a quasi-analytical approach is adopted, considering as small the sediment discharge with respect to the liquid discharge. The flux matrix eigenvalues and eigenvectors are found, and it is shown how sediment transport affects bedforms celerity and Riemann invariants. Secondly, a relaxation approach is proposed, to take properly into account the bedload time-adaptation to the local hydrodynamic conditions. In both cases, numerical computations are carried out using the Dumbser-Toro extension of the Osher Riemann Solver to non-conservative hyperbolic systems, in order to properly take into account the role of the bottom elevation as time-space variable.

The model solves the 2D Shallow Water Equations and the standard k-epsilon turbulence model. Bedload transport is estimated using the Meyer-Peter and Muller formula, and bed evolution is solved using the Exner Equation. The Markovian stochastic bank erosion model uses a new method to evaluate bank erosion risk. The approach was applied to a meander bend cutoff event in the Maiqu River on the Tibetan Plateau. Sixteen different bank-material critical shear stress cases were considered, representing highly erodible banks to resistant banks. Ten statistical realizations were performed for each case with different bank-material erodibility to obtain ensemble-averaged results. Flow field and bed evolution in the cutoff channel suggest that the model can successfully simulate bank erosion processes during the cutoff channel evolution, and bank topographic irregularities are reasonably captured. A newly introduced calibration parameter, the ratio of mesh size to the coupling period between the bank erosion model and the hydrodynamic & morphodynamic model, is not as intuitive as the erosion resistance calibration parameters used by the traditional bank erosion model. The proposed approach necessitates estimating the size of a typical slump failure, or 10-30% of the cutbank height, to set the size of the computational mesh.",2024,2024-12-03 02:47:30,2024-12-03 03:16:49,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Publisher: Authorea,,C:\Users\johan\Zotero\storage\ZTB3BE28\Li et al. - 2024 - Unveiling the Stochasticity of Bank Erosion A Hybrid Deterministic and Stochastic Modeling Approach.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Google-Scholar,unveilingthestochasticityofbankerosionahybriddeterministicandstochasticmodelingapproach,0.9259031414985657,0.4640272855758667,0.5248764157295227,0.28056666254997253,0.4144911468029022,0.6182217001914978,0.9921832084655762,0.0010113894240930676,0.27257633209228516,0.9787049889564514,0.03525909408926964,0.08601216971874237,0.2152526080608368,0.9857003092765808,0.9734564423561096,0.9316331148147583,0.004867810755968094,0.5792424082756042,0.8879963755607605,0.4697721600532532,0.4618765711784363,0.2715662717819214,0.03416481614112854,0.10061320662498474,0.7226738333702087,0.017176710069179535,0.02004261314868927,0.0199278537184,0.9740673303604126,0.0025758815463632345,0.02917362004518509,0.02203226648271084,0.04729369655251503,0.1995418667793274,0.026405518874526024,0.9871292114257812,0.8741846680641174,0.3444434404373169,0.0015397267416119576,0.009340024553239346,0.6584175229072571,0.13443464040756226,0.17766813933849335,0.31626370549201965

In practice, most of the methods used for its numerical resolution suffer from significant stability problems due to the fact that they are mainly guaranteed by separation techniques, which allow weak coupling between hydraulic and morphodynamic software. The search for an adequate alternative method to this problem is a focus towards which several approaches converge. Recently, many authors have proposed acceptable methods, but they are not so trivial to implement in an industrial context, and some do not take into account all aspects, such as mobile steady states. In this work, we derive a well-balanced scheme that takes into account all stable states, to approach weak solutions of the sediment transport model in shallow waters. We demonstrate that it captures exactly all regular steady solutions with non-evanescent velocities, retains water level positivity, and is able to degenerate to a classical shallow water model when the sedimentary transport flow is null. A number of numerical test cases are also presented to illustrate these properties.",2024,2024-12-03 02:47:30,2024-12-03 03:15:06,,166–189,,2,17,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,C:\Users\johan\Zotero\storage\CCDC8ZXT\Sore et al. - 2024 - A Godunov-type scheme for the Saint-Venant-Exner equations with a moving steady states.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Google-Scholar,agodunovtypeschemeforthesaintvenantexnerequationswithamovingsteadystates,0.9507990479469299,0.482626736164093,0.24168823659420013,0.13822610676288605,0.12713880836963654,0.17902936041355133,0.1843988448381424,0.08099906146526337,0.17956872284412384,0.02426966093480587,0.15842418372631073,0.2348989099264145,0.3653251528739929,0.9849389791488647,0.03072163835167885,0.1380665898323059,0.5502445697784424,0.7162526249885559,0.9772224426269531,0.35297125577926636,0.33809494972229004,0.16159534454345703,0.9794132113456726,0.1458437591791153,0.44987595081329346,0.015693791210651398,0.019197450950741768,0.004142016638070345,0.4529291093349457,0.07620120048522949,0.18257121741771698,0.03173859417438507,0.2091464400291443,0.6815147995948792,0.4418536126613617,0.9858956933021545,0.15002880990505219,0.1775968372821808,0.012920472770929337,0.012383786030113697,0.7760294675827026,0.15152932703495026,0.10498093068599701,0.25748494267463684

The models use the shallow water equations for hydrodynamics and the Exner sediment continuity equation for bed morphology. The governing equations are solved here using the finite difference method (FDM) based Lax-Wendroff scheme. The 1D model uses the fully coupled approach. The 2D model however solves the boundary fitted governing equations of water flow and sediment transport coupled using the semicoupled approach. The numerical oscillations produced due to second order accuracy of the proposed models are removed here by adopting an efficient Total Variation Diminishing (TVD) technique. The influence of helical flow intensity and lateral bed slope are integrated in the sediment transport model for correctly simulating the morphodynamics in channel bends. The practical applicability of the developed models is evaluated by replicating five benchmark test cases of known analytical and experimental results and promising outcomes are obtained. Three widely used statistical parameters are also calculated to check the robustness of the proposed models.,2024,2024-12-03 02:47:30,2024-12-03 03:22:26,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,C:\Users\johan\Zotero\storage\EPBKW99K\Goswami and Kalita - 2024 - Semicoupled and fully coupled numerical models for morphodynamic flow simulation in river with irreg.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Google-Scholar,semicoupledandfullycouplednumericalmodelsformorphodynamicflowsimulationinriverwithirregularplanforms,0.7306267023086548,0.31829097867012024,0.5164094567298889,0.2258596122264862,0.4344686269760132,0.30052027106285095,0.9688887596130371,0.9920271039009094,0.008477660827338696,0.02746138535439968,0.1766459047794342,0.4251082241535187,0.9556339383125305,0.9868423938751221,0.44231152534484863,0.7346612811088562,0.12868577241897583,0.6078214049339294,0.9003363251686096,0.5229524374008179,0.43622615933418274,0.2984408438205719,0.3341004252433777,0.2468055784702301,0.8039445877075195,0.03317983075976372,0.02745460718870163,0.05429892987012863,0.7593146562576294,0.16184942424297333,0.35242465138435364,0.055208686739206314,0.25711169838905334,0.8119743466377258,0.9802997708320618,0.9829218983650208,0.582164466381073,0.4702138900756836,0.026632411405444145,0.04698663577437401,0.925094723701477,0.3198114037513733,0.17881245911121368,0.34908878803253174

Such dams are prone to failure and therefore, simu lation of their failure and induced morphological changes is of great importance for hazard mitigation. Multi-layer and non-uniform sediments are usually observed in landslide dam materials, but these are rarely considered in simulations. In this paper, a two-dimensional numerical model considering multi-layered and non-uniform sediments is proposed. The model solves the shallow water equations, the Exner equation considering the different size fractions and Hirano’s active layer equation based on a finite volume scheme in a weakly coupled approach. Twoexperimental tests are used to assess the applicability and accuracy of the model. The results show that it can well simulate the flowand morphological changes, as well as the surface coarsening and fining phenomena related to multi-layer and non-uniform sediments. The numerical results of dam failure process and morphological changes are in overall good agreement with the experiments, but the peak discharge and bed elevation tend to be underestimated when finer material is considered.

In the developed model, we adopt a weakly coupled numerical approach to explicitly solve the governing equations, including 2D shallow water equations for fluid flow motion and the Exner equation for bed sediment movement at the same time step. A defined virtual bedload velocity in a weakly coupled approach is involved in the calculation of time step sizes. However, nonphysical virtual bedload velocities, which often occur in cases with nearly flat beds, require extremely small time step sizes. A formulation of the lower and upper bounds of information propagation speeds for an HLLC approximate Riemann solver is thus proposed to remedy the problem. Four case studies involving dam break flows in prismatic and erodible channels, knickpoint migration, dam erosion due to overtopping flow and dam-break flow in an erodible channel with an abrupt expansion are adopted to validate the developed model. In addition, to compare the performances of different particle interaction configurations under Cartesian uniform particle arrangements, four and eight interacting particles are obtained by changing the smoothing length. Against the measured results, the case of eight interacting particles shows more accurate predictions of erosion peaks along the measured cross-sections because the lateral flows are significant. The good agreement between the simulated and measured results shows that the developed 2D Eulerian SPH bedload sediment transport model with eight interacting particles is well suited for simulating complicated flow-induced bed erosion.",2024,2024-12-03 02:47:30,2024-12-03 03:19:00,,131002,,,634,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Publisher: Elsevier,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Google-Scholar,anew2desphbedloadsedimenttransportmodelforrapidlyvariedflowsovermobilebeds,0.9984565377235413,0.9986851811408997,0.6480583548545837,0.14481221139431,0.15146023035049438,0.11518062651157379,0.9980818033218384,0.06253842264413834,0.003834537463262677,0.0215433519333601,0.03567805886268616,0.06214030832052231,0.14879260957241058,0.9899032711982727,0.47910037636756897,0.948438286781311,0.19739308953285217,0.6097862124443054,0.9926620721817017,0.2991718351840973,0.2430814802646637,0.11284462362527847,0.9992461204528809,0.9642204642295837,0.9495759606361389,0.05749327689409256,0.019475214183330536,0.05775843933224678,0.9986303448677063,0.006957609206438065,0.11392416059970856,0.05675690248608589,0.11772419512271881,0.1655256599187851,0.04138471558690071,0.987129271030426,0.02792787365615368,0.5750213265419006,0.04881242290139198,0.04020024463534355,0.9941913485527039,0.11716746538877487,0.10734385251998901,0.21166113018989563

Many studies on morphological patterns in straight channels have been conducted, but full regime diagrams in fundamental parameters (e.g. aspect ratio and mobility parameter) are not known yet.  However, determining such morphological regimes is crucial for prediction of river dynamics and consequently for a range of applications, from flood risk assessment to ecological management and restoration projects. This study employs a 2D numerical model based on spectral methods to explore these morphodynamic regimes in a straight channel, a first approximation of most existing managed rivers. The model couples the depth-averaged shallow-water and continuity equations for the flow and the Exner mass-conservation equation for the sediment. The morphological patterns arising from the simulations are explored in a wide range of parameter space, beyond the critical values for bar formation used in perturbation methods. A thorough taxonomy of planforms and their complexity is generated, resulting in a morphodynamic regime diagram for straight channel flows. Moreover, both the spatial and temporal characterisation of the solutions is carried out, and the presence of quasi-periodic and chaotic behaviour is investigated.",2024,2024-12-03 02:47:30,2024-12-03 03:10:59,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Google-Scholar,numericalexplorationofthemorphodynamicregimediagramforstraightchannelriverflows,0.16328145563602448,0.45412686467170715,0.567244291305542,0.3420945107936859,0.3731696903705597,0.34947460889816284,0.9985851049423218,0.0031238615047186613,0.0009511859389021993,0.02862038090825081,0.040899645537137985,0.048660099506378174,0.1295592337846756,0.9690732359886169,0.2890242636203766,0.6899548768997192,0.005614042282104492,0.3898940682411194,0.896574854850769,0.46456459164619446,0.5172568559646606,0.2812657952308655,0.009143315255641937,0.08866234123706818,0.40480154752731323,0.044764310121536255,0.014899643138051033,0.010308207012712955,0.9967712163925171,0.002929241629317403,0.05184546485543251,0.14645308256149292,0.18198898434638977,0.11047116667032242,0.053998835384845734,0.22644132375717163,0.8250265717506409,0.2467147707939148,0.0032099615782499313,0.005786154419183731,0.16871994733810425,0.27464309334754944,0.239883154630661,0.2694697380065918

These models are adequate for solving quasi-hydrostatic flow problems, but their accuracy deteriorates as the effects of vertical acceleration gain significance. Herein, a higher-order numerical model for treating the problems of unsteady, plane open-channel flow over a movable bed is proposed. In this model, the flow hydrodynamics are governed by the depth-averaged Boussinesq-type equations, and the bed morphodynamics are determined by an Exner-type equation and additional equations describing the non-equilibrium transports of suspended load and bed load. A hybrid finite-volume and finite-difference scheme was used to discretize and solve the governing equations, yielding solutions that are in satisfactory agreement with experimental data. Overall, the results of the proposed model for the temporal free-surface profile and bed evolution were fairly adequate. For the two particular cases considered, however, the quality of its results was moderately affected by the three-dimensional characteristics of the dam-break flow and the sliding of the dike body due to sub-surface flow.

In most cases, the velocity related to the sediment is much lower that the fluid velocity, which, in turn, may be much lower that the free-surface wave speed. Explicit methods that resolve all waves require small time steps due to the CFL stability restriction because of fast surface waves. Furthermore, if Rusanov flux is adopted, slow sediment waves may be affected by the large numerical diffusion. The objective of the present work is to drastically improve the efficiency in the computation of the evolution of the sediment by treating water waves implicitly, thus allowing much larger time steps than the one required by fully explicit schemes. The goal is reached by suitably semi-implicit schemes obtained by the use of implicit-explicit Runge-Kutta methods.",2024,2024-12-03 02:47:30,2024-12-03 03:15:40,,112714,,,499,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Publisher: Elsevier,,C:\Users\johan\Zotero\storage\AWFMJ63P\Macca et al. - 2024 - A semi-implicit finite volume method for the Exner model of sediment transport.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Google-Scholar,asemiimplicitfinitevolumemethodfortheexnermodelofsedimenttransport,0.038525428622961044,0.5944827198982239,0.42244279384613037,0.3018730878829956,0.5413987636566162,0.38293665647506714,0.20061853528022766,0.14272385835647583,0.055242870002985,0.16449539363384247,0.9066733717918396,0.6363382339477539,0.5530499815940857,0.9728226065635681,0.08402326703071594,0.36559826135635376,0.5794914364814758,0.6697901487350464,0.5011796355247498,0.4969125986099243,0.4967319071292877,0.343965619802475,0.368320494890213,0.16013465821743011,0.33350321650505066,0.02598205767571926,0.012698200531303883,0.005080037284642458,0.3199707865715027,0.1063188686966896,0.17931489646434784,0.08866234868764877,0.9997246861457825,0.953144371509552,0.8163331747055054,0.9992504715919495,0.03850233182311058,0.18513552844524384,0.05023736506700516,0.010013571940362453,0.020508164539933205,0.20833995938301086,0.0681023821234703,0.21576356887817383

Our approach adapts the flux vector splitting method proposed by Toro and Vázquez-Cendón (2012) and separates the system into two subsystems: a conservative advection system and a non-conservative pressure system, both characterized by simpler eigenstructures compared to the full system. The numerical scheme combines a Godunov-type path-conservative method for the pressure system with a conservative Godunov method for the advection system, solved using a coupled solution strategy. To achieve second-order accuracy in space and time, the first-order method is enhanced via the ADER approach and an AENO reconstruction technique. The scheme's accuracy, robustness, and well-balanced properties are evaluated using a carefully chosen set of test cases, demonstrating its simplicity and effectiveness, comparable to advanced Godunov methods. A key feature of the proposed scheme is its flexibility in selecting sediment transport closure formulas, making it highly suitable for scientific and engineering applications.",2022-01,2024-09-25 15:14:12,2024-12-01 00:43:24,,104062,,,159.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Publisher: Elsevier BV,,C:\Users\johan\Zotero\storage\Y8XKV7FW\Siviglia et al. - 2022 - A splitting scheme for the coupled Saint-Venant-Exner model.pdf,,Sediment transport; Numerical morphodynamics; ADER Method; Finite volume methods; Flux splitting; Saint-Venant-Exner model,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Web-of-Science,asplittingschemeforthecoupledsaintvenantexnermodel,0.5323999524116516,0.5680115222930908,0.38137292861938477,0.2346772402524948,0.04744860529899597,0.35824504494667053,0.0003520690370351076,0.9997321963310242,0.08481710404157639,0.052969422191381454,0.08731336146593094,0.09242545068264008,0.2175498753786087,0.989476203918457,0.28963837027549744,0.7241579294204712,0.5370944738388062,0.6894683241844177,0.9650521278381348,0.5116132497787476,0.3958871066570282,0.2821865379810333,0.903464674949646,0.09130104631185532,0.6917576789855957,0.028034117072820663,0.021512309089303017,0.01621503010392189,0.011309892870485783,0.9966365098953247,0.2606716752052307,0.03908495604991913,0.0817393884062767,0.1792430579662323,0.22841456532478333,0.9980122447013855,0.09417667239904404,0.7027340531349182,0.0653061494231224,0.015633562579751015,0.9162595868110657,0.1784542202949524,0.10922977328300476,0.24095316231250763

Nevertheless, other possible applications exist. In particular, bed-load transport phenomena are relevant in urban drainage systems, including sewers. However, few applications of coupled two-dimensional (2D) shallow-water and bed-load transport models can be found, and their transfer from environmental applications?usually river and floodplain?into sewer applications requires some adaptation. Unlike to river systems, where there is a thick layer of sediment that constitutes a movable riverbed, sewer systems have thin layers of sediment that need to be removed, thus exposing a rigid, nonerodible surface. This problem requires careful numerical treatment to avoid generating errors and instability in the simulation. This paper deals with a numerical approach to tackle this issue in an efficient way that allows large-scale studies to be performed and provides empirical evidence that the proposed approach is accurate and applicable for sewage and channel-flushing problems.",2017,2024-09-25 15:14:13,2024-12-01 00:02:33,,,,9,143.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,_eprint: http://ascelibrary.org/doi/pdf/10.1061/%28ASCE%29HY.1943-7900.0001337,,C:\Users\johan\Zotero\storage\GPYCYZYL\Caviedes-Voullième et al. - 2017 - Two-Dimensional Numerical Simulation of Bed-Load Transport of a Finite-Depth Sediment Layer Applica.pdf,,Exner equation; Shallow water; Channel flushing; Finite-depth sediment layer; Graphics-processing unit (GPU) computing; Maximum erodability; Partially erodible bed; Thin sediment layer,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Web-of-Science,twodimensionalnumericalsimulationofbedloadtransportofafinitedepthsedimentlayerapplicationstochannelflushing,0.9725343585014343,0.1266910433769226,0.3050399720668793,0.28598353266716003,0.2382422238588333,0.18611246347427368,0.8229138851165771,0.00844771508127451,0.042850226163864136,0.0687798336148262,0.1116233840584755,0.19112713634967804,0.3967097997665405,0.8682008981704712,0.047154445201158524,0.023733453825116158,0.0021331901662051678,0.39995965361595154,0.9566034078598022,0.27407771348953247,0.32316669821739197,0.1429498940706253,0.9992889165878296,0.32386109232902527,0.3727049231529236,0.020626194775104523,0.01098694372922182,0.011915022507309914,0.9824568629264832,0.005479908082634211,0.5583872199058533,0.06471256911754608,0.38228553533554077,0.800614058971405,0.3431766629219055,0.9934738278388977,0.047824516892433167,0.9490590691566467,0.002757622394710779,0.011441684328019619,0.9315871000289917,0.11666334420442581,0.09122006595134735,0.15335889160633087

The Exner equation is used to model the morphological evolution of the bed, while a closure equation is needed to evaluate the rate of sediment transport. The system of Saint-Venant-Exner equations is solved in a fully coupled way using a finite-volume technique and a HLLC solver for the fluxes, with a novel wave-speed estimator adapted to the Exner equation. Wave speeds are usually derived by computing the eigenvalues of the full system, which is highly time-consuming when no analytical expression is available. In this paper, an eigenvalue analysis of the full system is conducted, leading to simple but still accurate wave-speed estimators. The new numerical scheme is then tested in three different situations: (1) a circular dam-break flow over movable bed, (2) an one-dimensional bed aggradation problem simulated on a 2D unstructured mesh and (3) the case of a dam-break flow in an erodible channel with a sudden enlargement, for which experimental measurements are available.

The flow hydrodynamics is represented by the shallow water equations, and the bed morphodynamics is represented by the Exner equation and an additional equation describing the nonequilibrium sediment transport. Sediment size distribution is represented by the median grain diameter and the standard deviation, instead of the usual modeling with multiple particle size classes. Various methods for computing bed elevation changes at a cross section due to erosion or deposition of sediment are proposed and tested, including an innovative approach that relates the spatial pattern of erosion and deposition rates to boundary shear stress distribution, which is calculated by the Merged Perpendicular Method. An explicit finite difference scheme is employed for solving the water and sediment governing equations. The pertinence of the model is examined for two hypothetical cases. The model is then tested on one set of laboratory experiments on bed degradation under steady flow, showing excellent model data fit, and indicating that incorporating a nonequilibrium sediment transport equation into the model structure is an important element in reproducing the bed degradation process. Finally, the model is applied to simulate the morphological changes taking place in the Ha! Ha! River (Quebec) after the failure of the Ha! Ha! Dyke on July 1996. Relevant results can be obtained in terms of changes in longitudinal bed profile and cross-sectional geometry as well as water levels, although some discrepancies are obtained between the simulated and surveyed cross-sectional geometries, mainly because bank failure and channel widening are not modeled.",2009-05-07,2024-11-20 00:35:49,2024-12-01 00:02:27,,,,,45.0,,,,,,,,,,English,,,,,,,"Place: 2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA Publisher: AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION Type: Article",,C:\Users\johan\Zotero\storage\TRMUSQZB\Abderrezzak and Paquier - 2009 - One-dimensional numerical modeling of sediment transport and bed deformation in open channels.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Web-of-Science,onedimensionalnumericalmodelingofsedimenttransportandbeddeformationinopenchannels,0.31528905034065247,0.1908799409866333,0.6679283976554871,0.28528183698654175,0.302103191614151,0.13253344595432281,0.0002900275285355747,0.9992409944534302,0.006300593260675669,0.05928609520196915,0.08122483640909195,0.39688411355018616,0.794339656829834,0.9395102262496948,0.9795699715614319,0.7573590874671936,0.012675351463258266,0.7399247884750366,0.939912736415863,0.29676419496536255,0.3487454056739807,0.14916153252124786,0.9129031300544739,0.41051992774009705,0.49384334683418274,0.05037732794880867,0.015439390204846859,0.019946934655308723,0.0030873690266162157,0.9985869526863098,0.03639090061187744,0.1259227693080902,0.20008835196495056,0.8764758706092834,0.8556100130081177,0.9487751126289368,0.5436205267906189,0.24184733629226685,0.008283628150820732,0.07323097437620163,0.9594212770462036,0.127815842628479,0.1976766735315323,0.31017178297042847

The solution strategy relies on a full coupling of the governing equations within each time step. The resulting system of governing equations contains nonconservative products related to the longitudinal and lateral bed slopes and source terms related to friction. The full problem is solved numerically on unstructured triangular grids, simultaneously updating the principal part and adding the source terms (friction) using a splitting technique. The principal part is solved by means of a novel second-order accurate upwind-biased centred scheme of the finite volume type, while the source terms are added to the problem by solving a system of ordinary differential equations. A new algorithm for treating the wetting-and-drying is also proposed. The model is applied to well-established test problems in order to verify the accuracy of the proposed method, the robustness of the wetting-and-drying algorithm and the ability of the model in dealing with transcritical flows. Finally we test the model ability to reproduce two dimensional morphodynamic processes occurring at the scale of tens of channel widths in bedload dominated alluvial rivers with homogeneous grain size. This is achieved by comparing model outcomes with those of analytical theories and flume experiments on the same morphodynamic processes.

The model includes a robust hydrodynamic solver for the integration of the nonlinear shallow water equations (NSWE) and a rather flexible solver for the resolution of the Exner equation (used to evaluate the morphological evolution of the seabed). A detailed analysis is given of existing and novel procedures for the solution of the morphodynamic problem. Coupling of NSWE and Exner equations and updating of the solution is made by means of a sequential splitting scheme. The model has been validated by reproducing both analytical and numerical solutions, available in the recent literature, as well as an in-house laboratory experiment. The simulation of existing theoretical solutions has revealed the model performs well, especially in the prediction of the seabed evolution due to either bed-load or suspended-load transport forced by dam-break and swash-type events. The latter ones are seen to force both erosion and accretion despite the weak hydro-morphodynamic coupling. The comparison between solver results and experimental data is also encouraging, the solver reproducing well the main seabed features forced by irregular waves. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

The model incorporates a variety of sediment transport capacity formulas proposed by Meyer-Peter and Muller, Bagnold, Engelund and Hansen, Ackers and White, Smart and Jaeggi, van Rijn, Rickenmann, Cheng, Abrahams and Camenen, and Larson. We examine the performance of each formula by simulating four idealized laboratory cases on dam-break waves over sandy beds. Comparisons between numerical results and measurements show that for each case better predictions are obtained using a particular formula, but overall, formulas proposed by Meyer-Peter and Muller (with the factor 8 being replaced by 12), Smart and Jaggi, Cheng, Abrahams and Camenen, and Larson rank as the best predictors for the entire range of conditions studied here.

First we show that the Saint-Venant-Exner equations are linearly unstable in most cases for a uniform base flow down an inclined erodible bed for Shields numbers in excess of the threshold for incipient sediment motion allowing us to compute noise-induced pattern formation for Froude numbers below 2. The wavelength of the bed forms are selected naturally due to the absolute character of the bed instability and the existence of a maximum growth rate at a finite wavelength when the particle diffusivity coefficient and the water eddy viscosity are present as for Turing-like instability. A num e rical method is subsequently developed to analyze the performance of the model and theoretical results through three examples: the simulation of the fluctuations of the particle concentration using a stochastic Langevin equation, the deterministic simulation of anti-dunes formation over an erodible slope in full sediment-mobility conditions, and the computation of noise-induced pattern formation in hybrid stochasticdeterministic flows down a periodic flume. The full non-linear numerical simulations are in excellent agreement with the theoretical solutions. We conclude highlighting that the proposed depth-averaged formulation explains the developments of upstream migrating anti-dunes in straight flumes since the seminar experiments by Gilbert (1914).

In particular, the dam-break/bore-collapse initial condition of Shen & Meyer (J. Fluid Mech., vol. 16, 1963, pp. 113-125) and Peregrine & Williams (J. Fluid Mech., vol. 440, 2001, pp. 391-399) is investigated using a numerical model based on the method of characteristics. A sediment-transport formula (cubic in velocity u: Au-3) is used here; this belongs to a family of sediment-transport formulae for which Pritchard & Hogg (Coastal Engng, vol. 52, 2005, pp. 1-23) showed that net sediment transport under the Shen & Meyer (1963) bore collapse is offshore throughout the swash zone when a non-erodible bed is considered. It is found that full coupling with the beach, although still resulting in the net offshore transport of sediment throughout the swash zone, leads to a large reduction in the net offshore transport of sediment from the beach face. This is particularly true for the upper third of the swash zone. Moreover, in contradistinction to swash flows over non-erodible beds, flows over erodible beaches are unique to the bed mobility and porosity under consideration; this has very important implications for run-up predictions. The conclusion is that it is essential to consider full coupling of water and bed motions (i.e. full morphodynamics) in order to understand and predict sediment transport in the swash, regardless of other physical effects (e.g. turbulence, infiltration, pre-suspended sediment, etc.).",2010-10-25,2024-11-20 00:35:49,2024-12-01 00:02:06,,316-340,,,661.0,,,,,,,,,,English,,,,,,,"Place: 32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA Publisher: CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS Type: Article",,C:\Users\johan\Zotero\storage\P9GCXTKN\Kelly and Dodd - 2010 - Beach-face evolution in the swash zone.pdf,,sediment transport; coastal engineering; shallow-water flows,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Web-of-Science,beachfaceevolutionintheswashzone,0.35649776458740234,0.26970842480659485,0.5294495820999146,0.2489827424287796,0.0993310734629631,0.18726900219917297,0.0025044840294867754,0.9989601373672485,0.016489412635564804,0.03181607276201248,0.020790521055459976,0.04489481821656227,0.07059371471405029,0.9241490960121155,0.0038845879025757313,0.17947663366794586,0.3303050100803375,0.4648973047733307,0.9488157629966736,0.4438657760620117,0.22032137215137482,0.0823403000831604,0.31106051802635193,0.7394224405288696,0.3712790906429291,0.015573562122881413,0.0075919413939118385,0.01214717049151659,0.011642225086688995,0.9980238080024719,0.5957571864128113,0.017193201929330826,0.1881001889705658,0.6572085022926331,0.2802222669124603,0.08374040573835373,0.025154883041977882,0.1173696517944336,0.9535353183746338,0.0016103574307635427,0.34284651279449463,0.07120273262262344,0.097906693816185,0.09568693488836288

The scheme is chosen because of its shock capturing capabilities and its relative simplicity, which allow different sediment transport formulae to be slotted in easily. A typical example of the kind of flows treated here is bore-driven wave run-up. The analogy with a dam-break on a mobile bed is used here to analyze the performance of the model. The model solves the nonlinear shallow water equations coupled with the Exner sediment balance equation for the mobile bed. Quasi-analytical solutions to this problem for different expressions for instantaneous sediment discharge formulae are used to test the performance of the scheme. Together with the existing solution for the Grass formula, a further solution is obtained for a different formula. Numerical tests were also carried out for a further formula that is an industry standard. The agreement of the results with the solutions is very good and consistent results were obtained for all the formulae tested.

Regarding the speed of the computation, the Exner equation slows down the already costly 2D shallow water model as the number of variables to solve is increased and the numerical stability is more restrictive. In order to reduce the computational effort required for simulating realistic scenarios, the authors have exploited the use of Graphics Processing Units in combination with non-trivial optimization procedures.

A system comprising shallow water equations and Exner equation is solved, in which sediment transport rate q is either dependent only on depth averaged velocity (u), or on u and water depth (12). The results are in agreement with equivalent uncoupled results [2] in that all sediment transport formulae considered applied to the event of [1] yield net erosion in the whole of the swash. Consistent with [3], however, full coupling yields significantly less erosion for all the q = q(u) formulae compared to the equivalent uncoupled results. It is shown that differences between uncoupled and coupled approaches (for most formulae) accumulate over the course of the swash event. The main reason for the reduced net erosion is the smaller maximum inundation. It is also shown that including a dependence on h in the bed load sediment transport formula for fully coupled simulations can result in net deposition in the upper swash. Bed shear stress described by a Chezy law is further included in fully coupled simulations to examine net beach change. Much reduced maximum inundation and net offshore sediment transport are predicted both for q = q(u) and q = q(h,u). It is shown that although the net sediment flux at the base of the swash under one [1] swash event is still offshore, deposition in the middle or upper swash may be predicted when bed shear stress is included, particularly when the drag coefficient in the backwash is reduced compared to that in the uprush, consistent with some in-situ measurements. The implication is that bed shear stress must be included not just to obtain correct quantitative beach change, but also to obtain correct qualitative beach behaviour. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

However, the impact of this technique on the hydraulics conditions, and resulting bed morphology, is yet to be understood. Several numerical tools have been developed during last years for modeling sediment transport and morphology evolution which can be used for this application. These models range from 1D to 3D approaches: the first being over simplistic for the simulation of such a complex geometry; the latter requires often a prohibitive computational effort. However, 2D models are computationally efficient and in these cases may already provide sufficiently accurate predictions of the morphology evolution caused by the sediment replenishment in a river. Here, the 2D shallow water equations in combination with the Exner equation are solved by means of a weak-coupled strategy. The classical friction approach considered for reproducing the bed channel roughness has been modified to take into account the morphological effect of replenishment which provokes a channel bed fining. Computational outcomes are compared with four sets of experimental data obtained from several replenishment configurations studied in the laboratory. The experiments differ in terms of placement volume and configuration. A set of analysis parameters is proposed for the experimental-numerical comparison, with particular attention to the spreading, covered surface and travel distance of placed replenishment grains. The numerical tool is reliable in reproducing the overall tendency shown by the experimental data. The effect of fining roughness is better reproduced with the approach herein proposed. However, it is also highlighted that the sediment clusters found in the experiment are not well numerically reproduced in the regions of the channel with a limited number of sediment grains.

In this paper, these equations are combined with the two-dimensional shallow water equations to describe the flow field. The resulting system of equations can be solved in two ways: (i) in a coupled way, solving flow and sediment equations simultaneously at a given time-step or (ii) in an uncoupled manner by first solving the flow field and using the magnitudes obtained at each time-step to update the channel morphology (bed and surface composition). The coupled strategy is preferable when dealing with strong and quick interactions between the flow field, the bed evolution and the different particle sizes present on the bed surface. A number of numerical difficulties at from solving the fully coupled system of equations. These problems are reduced by means of a weakly-coupled strategy to numerically estimate the wave celerities containing the information of the bed and the grain sizes present on the bed. Hence, a two-dimensional numerical scheme able to simulate in a self-stable way the unsteady morphological evolution of channels formed by cohesionless grain size mixtures is presented. The coupling technique is simplified without decreasing the number of waves involved in the numerical scheme but by simplifying their definitions. The numerical results are satisfactorily tested with synthetic cases and against experimental data. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The method is based on the floating grid-of-characteristics approach, which here is amended to take account of the more complex structure of the field of characteristics inherent in the morphodynamics (compared to those for hydro- or gas dynamics). Due to the relative simplicity of the algorithm the technique is particularly well suited to waves moving into a downstream reach that is initially dry. As with all MOC schemes the approach is also attractive because it reveals the underlying (morpho)dynamics as the solution progresses. The mathematical model considered here is based on the depth averaged non-linear shallow water equations directly coupled to a bed update (Exner) equation. Closure is obtained using a simple sediment flux relation. The technique described allows the study of fully coupled sediment transport problems and the associated hydro- and morphodynamic evolution. Numerical results are presented for the evolution of a sand dune in a tidal flow as well as the wet-dry dam-break problem on both a fixed and mobile bed. Results compare extremely well with the analytical or quasi-analytical solutions for the problems presented. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Moreover, these models are usually not well-balanced, meaning they are unable to correctly simulate quiescent flow. Here a well-balanced and flexible morphological model for the swash zone is presented. The nonlinear shallow water equations and the Exner equation are discretized by the shock-capturing finite volume method, in which the numerical flux and the bed slope source term are estimated by a well-balanced version of the SLIC (slope limited centered) scheme that does not depend on empirical sediment transport relations. The satisfaction of the well-balanced property is demonstrated through simulating quiescent coastal flow. The quantitative accuracy of the model in reproducing key parameters (i.e., the notional shoreline position, the swash depth, the flow velocity, the overtopping flow volume, the beach change depth and the sediment transport rate) is shown to be satisfactory through comparisons against analytical solutions, experimental data as well as previous numerical solutions. This work facilitates an improved modeling framework for the swash hydrodynamics and sediment transport. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

However, the resolution of the sediment continuity equation to simulate bed evolution is a complex problem which often leads to the development of numerical oscillations. To overcome this problem, addition of artificial diffusion or bathymetric filters are commonly employed methods, although these techniques can potentially over-smooth the bathymetry. This study aims to present a numerical scheme based on the Weighted Essentially Non-Oscillatory (WENO) formalism to solve the bed continuity equation on unstructured grids in a finite volume formulation. The new solution is compared against a classical method, which combines a basic node-centered finite volume method with artificial diffusion, for three idealized test cases. This comparison reveals that a higher accuracy is obtained with our new method while the addition of diffusion appears inappropriate mainly due to the arbitrary choice of the diffusion coefficient. Moreover, the increased computation time associated with the WENO-based method to solve the bed continuity equation is negligible when considering a fully-coupled simulation with tides and waves. Finally, the application of the new method to the pluri-monthly evolution of an idealized inlet subjected to tides and waves shows the development of realistic bed features (e.g. secondary flood channels, ebb-delta sandbars, or oblique sandbars at the adjacent beaches), that are smoothed or nonexistent when using additional diffusion.

The DOT path-conservative scheme is a robust upwind method based on a complete Riemann solver, but it has the drawback of requiring expensive numerical computations. Indeed, to compute the non-linear time evolution in each time step, the DOT scheme requires numerical computation of the flux matrix eigenstructure (the totality of eigenvalues and eigenvectors) several times at each cell edge. In this work, an analytical and compact formulation of the eigenstructure for the de Saint Venant-Exner (dSVE) model is introduced and tested in terms of numerical efficiency and stability. Using the original DOT and PRICE-C (a very efficient FORCE-type method) as reference methods, we present a convergence analysis (error against CPU time) to study the performance of the DOT method with our new analytical implementation of eigenstructure calculations (A-DOT). In particular, the numerical performance of the three methods is tested in three test cases: a movable bed Riemann problem with analytical solution; a problem with smooth analytical solution; a test in which the water flow is characterised by subcritical and supercritical regions. For a given target error, the A-DOT method is always the most efficient choice. Finally, two experimental data sets and different transport formulae are considered to test the A-DOT model in more practical case studies.",2018-03,2024-11-20 00:35:50,2024-12-01 00:02:08,,189-201,,,113.0,,,,,,,,,,English,,,,,,,"Place: THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND Publisher: ELSEVIER SCI LTD Type: Article",,C:\Users\johan\Zotero\storage\8HHJENYD\Carraro et al. - 2018 - Efficient analytical implementation of the DOT Riemann solver for the de Saint Venant-Exner morphody.pdf,,DOT Riemann solver; Non-conservative system; Path-conservative scheme; PRICE-C - FORCE; SWE - Exner,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Web-of-Science,efficientanalyticalimplementationofthedotriemannsolverforthedesaintvenantexnermorphodynamicmodel,0.44534891843795776,0.9810685515403748,0.9197027087211609,0.11032508313655853,0.06507919728755951,0.6708155870437622,0.10663213580846786,0.05204302817583084,0.00941595807671547,0.03674834966659546,0.02233893610537052,0.01605834998190403,0.034889932721853256,0.9927818775177002,0.427648663520813,0.6376133561134338,0.38560599088668823,0.9085366725921631,0.9527291059494019,0.3804354667663574,0.2696598470211029,0.2346845269203186,0.06723980605602264,0.2401503473520279,0.7041601538658142,0.009055264294147491,0.00528133288025856,0.012288597412407398,0.10393037647008896,0.02271575853228569,0.15228420495986938,0.02795439586043358,0.06250248104333878,0.01659317873418331,0.08218024671077728,0.9887771606445312,0.012870747596025467,0.10114465653896332,0.08748585730791092,0.19899646937847137,0.9222726225852966,0.12603028118610382,0.021145394071936607,0.18892180919647217

The mathematical formulation of this model consists of shallow water equations for the hydrodynamical component and an Exner equation expressing sediment continuity for the bedload transport. This method uses the moving least squares (MLS) function approximation to construct the shape functions and the minimizing least squares functional method to discretize the system of equations. The method can be viewed as a truly meshless method as it does not need any mesh for both field variable approximation and the construction of system matrices; it also provides the symmetric coefficient matrix. In the present work, several benchmark problems are studied and compared with the work of other researchers; the proposed method shows good accuracy, high convergence rate, and high efficiency, even for irregularly distributed nodes. At the end, a real test problem is performed to show and verify the main benefit and applicability of the proposed method to cope with complex geometry in practical problems. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

The method is based on the original Lagrangian-Eulerian CSPH-TVD approach for solving the Saint-Venant and Exner equations, taking into account the physical factors essential for the understanding of the shallow water and surface soil layer motions, including complex terrain structure and its evolution due to sediment transport. Additional Exner equation for sediment transport has been used for the numerical CSPH-TVD scheme stability criteria definition. By using OpenMP-CUDA and GPUDirect technologies for hybrid computing systems (supercomputers) with several graphic coprocessors (GPUs) interacting with each other via the PCI-E/NVLINK interface we also develop a parallel numerical algorithm for the CSPH-TVD method. The developed parallel version of the algorithm demonstrates high efficiency for various configurations of Nvidia Tesla CPU + GPU computing systems. In particular, maximal speed up is 1800 for a system with four C2070 GPUs compare to the serial version for the CPU. The calculation time on the GPU V100 (Volta architecture) is reduced by 95 times compared to the GPU C2070 (Fermi architecture). © 2020, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.",2020,2024-11-21 20:41:53,2024-12-01 00:02:05,,1475-1484,,8,41.0,,,,,,,,,,English,,,,,,,Publisher: Pleiades journals,,C:\Users\johan\Zotero\storage\RLGLH5PT\Khrapov and Khoperskov - 2020 - Application of Graphics Processing Units for Self-Consistent Modelling of Shallow Water Dynamics and.pdf,,OpenMP; SWE-Exner; parallel computing; GPU; HPC; 2D; CUDA; Numerical Method; GPUs; numerical methods; shallow water model,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Web-of-Science,applicationofgraphicsprocessingunitsforselfconsistentmodellingofshallowwaterdynamicsandsedimenttransport,0.10703616589307785,0.2825007736682892,0.9882073402404785,0.7632787823677063,0.2701336443424225,0.18225161731243134,0.2795867621898651,0.1593194305896759,0.13529637455940247,0.006771160289645195,0.053785260766744614,0.07287367433309555,0.1533370167016983,0.9909439086914062,0.24822787940502167,0.8779251575469971,0.13413941860198975,0.8016043901443481,0.7278881669044495,0.46969878673553467,0.5305910110473633,0.42385321855545044,0.006085737142711878,0.007937994785606861,0.9975985884666443,0.9627081751823425,0.04773565009236336,0.004681822843849659,0.19421495497226715,0.009559400379657745,0.18937112390995026,0.010944576933979988,0.06650852411985397,0.0645354762673378,0.026912303641438484,0.9998928308486938,0.014871002174913883,0.7423283457756042,0.01540972851216793,0.009485713206231594,0.019531238824129105,0.06477169692516327,0.04414209723472595,0.1856517344713211

The governing equations consist of three coupled model components: (i) the shallow water equations for the hydrodynamical model, (ii) a transport equation for the dispersion of suspended sediments, and (iii) an Exner equation for the morphological model. These coupled models form a hyperbolic system of conservation laws with source terms. The proposed finite volume method consists of a predictor stage for the discretization of gradient terms and a corrector stage for the treatment of source terms. The gradient fluxes are discretized using a modified Roe's scheme using the sign of the Jacobian matrix in the coupled system. A well-balanced discretization is used for the treatment of source terms. In this paper, we also describe an adaptive procedure in the finite volume method by monitoring the concentration of suspended sediments in the computational domain during its transport process. The method uses unstructured meshes, incorporates upwinded numerical fluxes and slope limiters to provide sharp resolution of steep sediment concentration and bed-load gradients that may form in the approximate solution. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2011.",2011,2024-11-21 21:06:48,2024-12-01 00:02:01,,875 – 891,,,4.0,,,,,,,,Springer Verlag,,English,,,,,,,ISSN: 21905614 Type: Article,,C:\Users\johan\Zotero\storage\WHTXBMD8\Benkhaldoun et al. - 2011 - A two-dimensional finite volume solution of dam-break hydraulics over erodible sediment beds.pdf,,Finite volume method; Sediment transport; Sedimentation; Suspended sediments; SWE-Exner; shallow water equations; Shallow water equations; 2D; Numerical Method; FVM; Equations of motion; finite volume method; Hydraulics; Governing equations; Jacobian matrices; Numerical methods; Approximate solution; Computational domains; Finite volume solution; Hydrodynamical model; Hyperbolic system of conservation laws; Sediment concentration; Two dimensional,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Web-of-Science,atwodimensionalfinitevolumesolutionofdambreakhydraulicsovererodiblesedimentbeds,0.9586133360862732,0.43214333057403564,0.6169940829277039,0.38783881068229675,0.40223172307014465,0.49659672379493713,0.998846173286438,0.0009984319331124425,0.03117201291024685,0.09668687731027603,0.990173876285553,0.6924383640289307,0.5573630928993225,0.7832449674606323,0.5944651961326599,0.8211367130279541,0.19557179510593414,0.5724400281906128,0.8097131848335266,0.6528216600418091,0.5618337392807007,0.446134477853775,0.7354041337966919,0.10338596254587173,0.6595147848129272,0.027585284784436226,0.01057048887014389,0.022846199572086334,0.9989119172096252,0.0004556365602184087,0.09467770159244537,0.060307640582323074,0.9998365044593811,0.7151256799697876,0.29982221126556396,0.9894703030586243,0.016355833038687706,0.8843891620635986,0.08670936524868011,0.004256349056959152,0.08834722638130188,0.0976482406258583,0.07120273262262344,0.22686925530433655

We show that, for some bedload transport models like the well-known Meyer-Peter and Müller model, the system is hyperbolic and, thus, linearly stable, only under some constraint on the velocity. In practical situations, this condition is hopefully fulfilled. Numerical approximations of such system are often based on a splitting method, solving first shallow water equation on a time step and, updating afterwards the topography. It is shown that this strategy can create spurious/unphysical oscillations which are related to the study of hyperbolicity. Using an upper bound of the largest eigenvector may improve the results although the instabilities cannot be always avoided, e.g. in supercritical regions.",2011,2024-11-21 21:48:33,2024-12-01 00:35:49,,980–989,,8,34.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Publisher: Elsevier,,"C:\Users\johan\Zotero\storage\27ZC6E6I\Cordier et al. - 2011 - Bedload transport in shallow water models Why splitting (may) fail, how hyperbolicity (can) help.pdf",,Sediment transport; Exner equation; Stability; Hyperbolicity; Shallow water system; Splitting methods,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Web-of-Science,bedloadtransportinshallowwatermodelswhysplittingmayfailhowhyperbolicitycanhelp,0.9909336566925049,0.266610711812973,0.07094507664442062,0.05884309485554695,0.006332769524306059,0.016726762056350708,0.06671636551618576,0.04089048132300377,0.008371482603251934,0.01160469464957714,0.011135902255773544,0.00716314697638154,0.019006405025720596,0.908490777015686,0.03988870978355408,0.09032126516103745,0.020118827000260353,0.17680004239082336,0.8964623808860779,0.21595509350299835,0.029754668474197388,0.03174901753664017,0.9993188381195068,0.29930996894836426,0.08882030099630356,0.008219693787395954,0.0016711376374587417,0.004174367059022188,0.3261640965938568,0.05232762545347214,0.3967399299144745,0.041773878037929535,0.11772420257329941,0.09756221622228622,0.3687465786933899,0.25701844692230225,0.060529377311468124,0.005808670073747635,0.00930394884198904,0.002565864473581314,0.1916300356388092,0.09033346176147461,0.044931646436452866,0.15140382945537567

In addition, a new method is proposed for computing the water depth and velocity values along the shear wave. This method ensures smooth solutions, even for flows with high discontinuities, and on domains with highly distorted grids. The numerical model is tested for channel aggradation on a sloping bottom, dam-break cases at flume-scale and reach-scale with flat bottom configurations and varying downstream water depths. The proposed model is tested for predicting the position of hydraulic jump, wave front propagation, and for predicting magnitude of bed erosion.

Theoretical models based on two-dimensional shallow water and Exner equations have been successfully employed to capture the bar instability phenomenon, and to estimate bar properties such as height, wavelength and migration rate. However, the mathematical complexity of the problem hampered the understanding of the key physical mechanisms that sustain bar formation. To fill this gap, we considered a simplified version of the equations, based on neglecting the deformation of the free surface, which allows us to: (a) provide the first complete explanation of the bar formation mechanism as the result of a simple bond between variations of the water weight and flow acceleration; (b) derive a simplified, physically based formula for predicting bar formation in a river reach, depending on channel width-to-depth ratio, Shields number and relative submergence. Comparison with an unprecedented large set of laboratory experiments reveals that our simplified formula appropriately predicts alternate bar formation in a wide range of conditions. Noteworthy, the hypothesis of negligible free surface effect also implies that bar formation is fully independent of the Froude number. We show that this intriguing property is intimately related to the three-dimensional nature of river bars, which allows for a gentle lateral deviation of the flow without significant deformation of the water surface.",2021-12,2024-11-22 21:19:57,2024-12-01 00:02:10,,,,12,57.0,,,,,,,,,,English,,,,,,,"Place: 2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA Publisher: AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION Type: Article",,C:\Users\johan\Zotero\storage\YA66ZL29\Redolfi - 2021 - Free Alternate Bars in Rivers Key Physical Mechanisms and Simple Formation Criterion.pdf,,sediment transport; river; instability; alternate bars; formation criterion; formation mechanism,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Web-of-Science,freealternatebarsinriverskeyphysicalmechanismsandsimpleformationcriterion,0.713066041469574,0.8198701739311218,0.37298792600631714,0.38094085454940796,0.5820726156234741,0.5396528244018555,0.013546913862228394,0.0036727185361087322,0.03186066448688507,0.2515092194080353,0.24646268784999847,0.5159378051757812,0.6508404016494751,0.9273601174354553,0.9943158626556396,0.7854909896850586,0.04248717054724693,0.6793869733810425,0.9165559411048889,0.4479358196258545,0.46105220913887024,0.29591426253318787,0.10941996425390244,0.8109285235404968,0.02313133515417576,0.013428255915641785,0.02136888913810253,0.006890458986163139,0.1536126434803009,0.03277498111128807,0.1536126583814621,0.05712397024035454,0.17140765488147736,0.01361058745533228,0.1211128756403923,0.010388216003775597,0.8895288705825806,0.41571399569511414,0.007907291874289513,0.0037434976547956467,0.05374994874000549,0.12458530813455582,0.16052906215190887,0.11521199345588684

The presence of underlying bedrock strata covered by erodible bed layers is ubiquitous in rivers and estuaries. In the last years, the development of models based on the non-capacity sediment transport assumption, also called non-equilibrium assumption, has offered a new theoretical background to deal with complex non-erodible bed configurations and the associated numerical problems. Bedload non-capacity sediment transport models consider that the actual solid transport state can be different from the equilibrium state and depending on the temporal evolution of the flow. The treatment of finite-depth erodible bed layers, i.e. partially erodible beds, in bedload models based on the equilibrium approach has usually been made using numerical fixes, which correct the unphysical results obtained in some cases. Generally, the presence of a finite-depth erodible layer implies the introduction of a kind of non-equilibrium condition in the bedload transport state. Nevertheless, this common natural bed configuration has not been previously considered in the development of numerical models. In this work, a finite volume model (FVM) for bedload transport based on non-capacity approach and dealing with finite-depth erodible layers is proposed. New expressions for the actual bedload transport rate and the net exchange flux through the static-moving bed layers interface are used to develop a numerical scheme which solves the coupled shallow water and non-capacity bedload transport system of equations. The reconstruction of the intermediate states for the local Riemann problem at each intercell edge is designed to correctly model the presence of non-erodible strata, avoiding the appearance of unphysical results in the approximate solution without reducing the time step. The new coupled scheme is tested against laboratory benchmarking experiments in order to demonstrate its stability and accuracy, pointing out the properties of both equilibrium and non-equilibrium formulations.",2019-08,2024-11-22 21:19:57,2024-12-01 00:01:51,,91-112,,,130.0,,,,,,,,,,English,,,,,,,"Place: THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND Publisher: ELSEVIER SCI LTD Type: Article",,C:\Users\johan\Zotero\storage\9PASBC3D\Martinez-Aranda et al. - 2019 - A comparative analysis of capacity and non-capacity formulations for the simulation of unsteady flow.pdf,,Finite volume method; Shallow water equations; Augmented Roe's scheme; Finite-depth erodible layer; Fully coupled method; Non-capacity bedload transport,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Web-of-Science,acomparativeanalysisofcapacityandnoncapacityformulationsforthesimulationofunsteadyflowsoverfinitedeptherodiblebeds,0.9945288300514221,0.4407784342765808,0.7069790959358215,0.4292275607585907,0.43146055936813354,0.500474214553833,0.21845774352550507,0.1718464493751526,0.021769098937511444,0.2230309545993805,0.9447259306907654,0.5075757503509521,0.5901317000389099,0.9891565442085266,0.8805866837501526,0.9178016781806946,0.749767541885376,0.7526044249534607,0.9390847086906433,0.5789429545402527,0.5608851909637451,0.40388643741607666,0.9990302920341492,0.03960167616605759,0.3010023832321167,0.01332514826208353,0.03346293792128563,0.012576348148286343,0.26635727286338806,0.015754247084259987,0.11838510632514954,0.0693524032831192,0.9943908452987671,0.7810802459716797,0.3554392158985138,0.8411744236946106,0.08601588755846024,0.6917576789855957,0.01709447242319584,0.007107631769031286,0.36220744252204895,0.1827899068593979,0.19821934401988983,0.26507115364074707

In these conditions bed load is the dominant mode of sediment transport. Laboratory experiments of a single bore-driven swash event are simulated numerically using a fully-coupled model that solves the system of Non Linear Shallow Water Equations and the Exner sediment conservation formula. The analysis focuses on two aspects: the optimal choice of parameters for the Meyer-Peter and Muller sediment transport formula and the model used for computing the shear stress. The methods tested for the bed shear stress are the momentum integral method and the Chezy formulation in which the friction factor is computed using two different formulae. Infiltration into the beach and its effects on the shear stress and sediment transport are also modelled. Results show that the basic Meyer-Peter and Muller sediment transport formula provides good results in the run-up. On the other hand, the sediment transport in the early stage of the backwash is overestimated. A reduction of the sediment mobility constant in the formula in the backwash marginally improves the results. However, the causes of the overestimation of the sediment transport at the early stage of the backwash is the overestimation of the shear stress, while at later stages there are several contributions that are identified, i.e. modelling of the sediment transport and infiltration. It is also suggested that the Meyer-Peter and Muller sediment transport formula might not capture the complexity of the processes involved during the backwash. The comparison of the methods for the estimate of the bed shear stress show that comparable results can be obtained using the momentum integral method and the Chezy formulation with time and space varying friction factor.

A multi-scale analysis is performed in order to take into account that the velocity of the sediment layer is smaller than the one of the fluid layer. This leads us to consider a shallow water type system for the fluid layer and a lubrication Reynolds equation for the sediment one. This deduction provides some improvements with respect to the classic Saint-Venant-Exner model: (i) the deduced model has an associated energy. Moreover, it allows us to explain why classic models do not have an associated energy and how they can be modified in order to recover a model with this property. (ii) The model incorporates naturally a necessary modification that must be taken into account in order to be applied to arbitrarily sloping beds. Furthermore, we show that in general this modification is different from the ones considered classically. Nevertheless, it coincides with a classic one in the case of constant free surface. (iii) The deduced solid transport discharge naturally depends on the thickness of the moving sediment layer, which allows to ensure sediment mass conservation. Moreover, we include a simplified version of the model for the case of quasi-stationary regimes. Some of these simplified models correspond to a generalization of classic ones such as Meyer-Peter and Muller and Ashida-Michiue models. Three numerical tests are presented to study the evolution of a dune for several definition of the repose angle, to see the influence of the proposed definition of the effective shear stress in comparison with the classic one, and by comparing with experimental data.",2017-02,2024-11-22 21:19:57,2024-12-01 00:02:10,,115-145,,1,51.0,,,,,,,,,,English,,,,,,,"Place: 17, AVE DU HOGGAR, PA COURTABOEUF, BP 112, F-91944 LES ULIS CEDEX A, FRANCE Publisher: EDP SCIENCES S A Type: Article",,C:\Users\johan\Zotero\storage\S93ARP7R\Fernandez-Nieto et al. - 2017 - FORMAL DEDUCTION OF THE SAINT-VENANT-EXNER MODEL INCLUDING ARBITRARILY SLOPING SEDIMENT BEDS AND ASS.pdf,,Saint-Venant-Exner; bedload; Reynolds equation,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Web-of-Science,formaldeductionofthesaintvenantexnermodelincludingarbitrarilyslopingsedimentbedsandassociatedenergy,0.515065610408783,0.3537307381629944,0.28019779920578003,0.12967342138290405,0.08730100840330124,0.23294326663017273,0.10665310174226761,0.029743637889623642,0.01588371954858303,0.02698659338057041,0.022319640964269638,0.04684128239750862,0.15844844281673431,0.9033546447753906,0.08978705108165741,0.16463977098464966,0.22572770714759827,0.30785074830055237,0.7436670660972595,0.3857605457305908,0.14575009047985077,0.070301853120327,0.8262916803359985,0.5785672664642334,0.21166114509105682,0.01858215034008026,0.014420067891478539,0.017576884478330612,0.18097354471683502,0.004700060468167067,0.33111971616744995,0.026531338691711426,0.08913694322109222,0.013902058824896812,0.02590802311897278,0.010248602367937565,0.02029348723590374,0.303886741399765,0.07828931510448456,0.0020308548118919134,0.10123346745967865,0.281504362821579,0.14229147136211395,0.25478699803352356

A numerical breach model for progressive embankment breaching is proposed, taking the seepage flow into account including its influence on slope stability due to apparent cohesion effects. Overtopping and embankment surface erosion are computed using finite-volume methods applied to the 2D shallow-water and the Exner equations. The seepage flow is modelled using a Lattice-Boltzmann approach solving the 3D Richards' equation. The modules are executed in a coupled manner with dynamically adapted boundary conditions. The breach side wall failures are considered using a geometrical approach based on critical failure angles. This approach is enhanced to account for apparent cohesion effects by dynamically adapting the critical failure angles as a function of the water saturation in a heuristic way, as a major enhancement compared to previous approaches.

The hydrodynamic equations are based on the well-known, two-dimensional depth-averaged non-linear shallow water equations, with bathymetry forces and friction, which are subsequently coupled to the Exner equation to describe the morphological evolution. Different forms of the bed-load transport flux are considered in the Exner equation and certain relations between them are established. The numerical model is expressed in a fully-coupled form where a single system of equations is solved by a high resolution two-dimensional finite volume scheme of the relaxation type. The relaxation is performed by classical models where neither approximate Riemann solvers nor characteristic decompositions are needed. The overall numerical scheme is validated in benchmark problems, and for a realistic application of a coastal area on the northern side of the island of Crete. The validity of these results is established by comparisons made with the well-known MIKE Software by DHI Group. (C) 2014 IMACS. Published by Elsevier B.V.

The sandy bed is seen as a structure with low stiffness. We start with a model problem featuring the behaviour of the coupling. Then, the water motion in shallow domains is described by the Saint-Venant equations. This coupling bringing the bottom sea changes is based on the assumption that the bed adapts to the flow in order to minimise some energy quantity together with minimal sand transport. The approach is shown being equivalent to the use of an Exner equation for the bed with a non-local expression for the sediment transport flux. Because the choice of the functional permits to include different physical quantities one thinks to play a role in the bottom morphodynamics, the approach is also a tool for validating different modelling hypothesis.",2012,2024-11-22 21:19:58,2024-12-01 00:02:19,,163-172,,3,26.0,,,,,,,,,,English,,,,,,,"Place: 2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND Publisher: TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD Type: Article",,C:\Users\johan\Zotero\storage\WKRPQRE2\Bouharguane and Mohammadi - 2012 - Minimisation principles for the evolution of a soft sea bed interacting with a shallow sea.pdf,,Saint-Venant equations; Exner equation; fluid-structure coupling; sandy beach morphodynamics; sensitivity analysis; shape optimisation,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Web-of-Science,minimisationprinciplesfortheevolutionofasoftseabedinteractingwithashallowsea,0.27494263648986816,0.47971558570861816,0.23509132862091064,0.14866600930690765,0.08336646109819412,0.05988568812608719,0.14794988930225372,0.06752275675535202,0.005649426952004433,0.028088612481951714,0.02475711517035961,0.033852946013212204,0.07333553582429886,0.05325862020254135,0.0009686971316114068,0.008332659490406513,0.8204613327980042,0.03456980362534523,0.3447152376174927,0.33685940504074097,0.19305521249771118,0.11518226563930511,0.04954301938414574,0.10176784545183182,0.0817393809556961,0.005220125429332256,0.0023413405288010836,0.0022474629804491997,0.24454335868358612,0.0762011930346489,0.02668309211730957,0.02515488490462303,0.016705093905329704,0.028355201706290245,0.014957086183130741,0.041695769876241684,0.002565864473581314,0.06187598779797554,0.8874974846839905,0.0017614697571843863,0.6101921796798706,0.05019078776240349,0.07217757403850555,0.05475202575325966

The governing equation is the modified 1D shallow water equation and the Exner equation that take both bed load and suspended load transport into account. The non-equilibrium sediment transport algorithm was adopted in the model, and the van Rijn method was employed to calculate the bed-load transport rate and the concentration of suspended sediment at the reference level. Flux terms in the governing equations were discretised using the upwind flux scheme, Harten et al. (1983) (HLL) and HLLC schemes, Roe's scheme and the Weighted Average Flux (WAF) schemes with the Double Minmod and Minmod flux limiters. The model was tested under a fixed bed condition to evaluate the performance of several different numerical schemes and then applied to an experimental case of dam break flow over a mobile bed and a flood event in the Rillito River, Tucson, Arizona. For dam break flow over movable bed, all tested schemes were proved to be capable of reasonably simulating water surface profiles, but failed to accurately capture the hydraulic jump. The WAF schemes produced slight spurious oscillations at the water surface and bed profiles and over-estimated the scour depth. When applying the model to the Rillito River, the simulated results generally agreed well with the field measurements of flow discharges and bed elevation changes. Modeling results of bed elevation changes were sensitive to the suspended load recovery coefficient and the bed load adaptation length, which require further theoretical and experimental investigations.

It is shown that a well balanced 2D model can predict flow features, sediment and scalar concentration, and bed elevation with an accuracy that is suitable for practical river engineering. The term “balanced” implies that important physical processes are modeled with a similar degree of complexity and exhaustiveness. The starting point of the model formulation is the assumption of self-similarity of vertical velocity profiles (horizontal velocities in the longitudinal and transverse directions), that are scaled by shear velocity and streamline curvature, both resolved by the model. The former is scaled by a bed-resistance coefficient that must be estimated or calibrated - as usual on a application-specific basis, and the latter is computed by a new, grid-based but grid orientation independent, scheme that acts on the discrete solution. All processes, including bottom shear, momentum dispersion, scalar dispersion, turbulent diffusion, bed load, and suspended load, are modeled using physically based, averaged values of empirical or semi-empirical constants, and consistently with the assumed velocity profiles (and bed-generated turbulence). Bed deformation modeling can be implemented with either an equilibrium or non-equilibrium formulation of the Exner equation, depending on the adaptation length scale, which must be taken under consideration if significantly larger than the length scale of the spatial discretization. The governing equations are solved by high-resolution, unstructured-grid Godunov method, which is elsewhere tested and shown to be reliable and second-order accurate. Application of the model to laboratory test cases, using standard parameter values and previously reported bed-resistance coefficients, gives results comparable to many 2D and 3D models previously applied to the same cases, most part of which benefit from case-specific parameter tuning. There are obviously intrinsic limits to the descriptive ability of 2D models in river modeling, but the results of this study point to the utility and cost-effectiveness of a well-designed 2D model.

The analysis is usually conducted focusing the asymptotic fate of small disturbances, using normal modes. In this work we instead have tackled another aspect of the stability problem studying the disturbance behavior at finite times. Recent studies have in fact shown that nonnormality of differential operators can induce a nonmonotonic decay of disturbances in asymptotically stable cases and the occurrence of transient growths. We have investigated these aspects for the de Saint-Venant-Exner equations and discussed the transient behavior of the energy of disturbances for both fixed and movable bed conditions. We show that the former case provides weak levels of nonnormality; while the latter can give rise to important transient growths. These growths result from uniquely linear mechanisms, are potentially able to trigger nonlinear instabilities, and are physically due to a transfer of potential energy between the water stream and the bed.

A one-dimensional (1-D) model is built upon the Saint-Venant equations for shallow water waves, the Exner equation of sediment mass conservation and a spatial lag equation for non-equilibrium sediment transport. The set of governing equations is solved using an explicit finite difference scheme. The model is tested in various idealized experimental cases, with fairly good agreement between the numerical predictions and measurements. Discrepancies are observed at the earlier stage of the dam-break wave and around the dam location due to no vertical velocity component being taken into account. Sensitivity tests confirm that the friction coefficient is an important parameter for the evaluation of sediment transport processes operating during a dam-break wave. The influence of the non-equilibrium adaptation length (or the lag distance) is negligible on the wavefront celerity and weak on the free surface and bed profiles, which indicates that one may ignore the spatial lag effect in dam-break wave studies. Finally, the simulation of the Lake Ha!Ha! dyke-break flood event shows that the model can provide relevant results if a convenient formula for computing the sediment transport capacity and an appropriate median grain diameter of riverbed material are selected.",2008-04,2024-11-22 21:19:58,2024-12-01 00:02:27,,169-198,,2,8.0,,,,,,,,,,English,,,,,,,"Place: VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS Publisher: SPRINGER Type: Article",,C:\Users\johan\Zotero\storage\8JMEUDGM\Abderrezzak et al. - 2008 - One-dimensional numerical modelling of dam-break waves over movable beds application to experimenta.pdf,,sediment transport; dam-break wave; Ha!Ha!

The one-dimensional de Saint Venant and Exner equations are solved numerically for the ideal case of a frictionally dominated estuary consisting of noncohesive sediment and with insignificant intertidal storage of water in tidal flats and salt marshes. This class of estuaries turns out to be invariably flood dominated. The resulting asymmetries in surface elevations and tidal currents lead to a net sediment flux within a tidal cycle which is directed landward. As a consequence, sediments are trapped within the estuary and the bottom profile evolves asymptotically toward an equilibrium configuration, allo wing a vanishing net sediment flux everywhere and, in accordance with field observations, a nearly constant value of the maximum flood/ebb speed. Such an equilibrium bed profile is characterized by a concavity increasing as the estuary convergence increases and by a uniquely determined value of the depth at the inlet section. The final length of the estuary is fixed by the longitudinal extension of the very shallow area which tends to form in the landward portion of the estuary. Note that sediment advection is neglected in the analysis, an assumption appropriate to the case of not too fine sediment.",2002-01-15,2024-11-22 21:19:58,2024-12-01 00:02:19,,,,C1,107.0,,,,,,,,,,English,,,,,,,"Place: 2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA Publisher: AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION Type: Article",,C:\Users\johan\Zotero\storage\56JBTKWU\Lanzoni and Seminara - 2002 - Long-term evolution and morphodynamic equilibrium of tidal channels.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Web-of-Science,longtermevolutionandmorphodynamicequilibriumoftidalchannels,0.20505093038082123,0.2662821412086487,0.19256338477134705,0.09431321173906326,0.058690235018730164,0.06794422119855881,0.00043367999023757875,0.9933918118476868,0.13589340448379517,0.0019046786474063993,0.021869413554668427,0.05169359967112541,0.09003988653421402,0.9213730096817017,0.6022444367408752,0.08575735241174698,0.03225608542561531,0.0718817487359047,0.9419577121734619,0.2474156618118286,0.13362601399421692,0.06282594054937363,0.02898062951862812,0.047691281884908676,0.11446747928857803,0.01756003126502037,0.004645557142794132,0.005395408719778061,0.00220838887616992,0.9988372921943665,0.46700507402420044,0.01660912111401558,0.2564128339290619,0.12294381111860275,0.22755514085292816,0.007066400721669197,0.09260568022727966,0.026056302711367607,0.31310465931892395,0.001827942905947566,0.024845438078045845,0.16817279160022736,0.167286679148674,0.1504652202129364

This model solves shallow water and Exner equations with a weakly coupled approach while the fluxes at the interfaces of the cells are calculated thanks to a lateralized HLLC flux scheme. Besides describing the model, we ran it for four different test cases: a steady flow on an inclined bed leading to aggradation or degradation, a dam-break leading to high interaction between the flow and the bed, a dam-break with a symmetrical enlargement close to the gate and a dam-break in a channel with a 90 degrees bend. The gathered results are discussed and compared to an existing fully coupled approach based on HLLC fluxes. Although both models equally perform regarding water levels, the weakly coupled model looks to better predict the bed evolution for the four test cases. In particular, its results are not affected by an excessive numerical diffusion encountered by the coupled model. Moreover, it usually better estimates the amplitudes of the maximum deposits and scours. It is also more stable when subject to high bed-flow interaction.",2020-09,2024-11-22 21:19:57,2024-12-01 00:01:45,,1351-1369,,5,22.0,,,,,,,,,,English,,,,,,,"Place: ALLIANCE HOUSE, 12 CAXTON ST, LONDON SW1H0QS, ENGLAND Publisher: IWA PUBLISHING Type: Article",,C:\Users\johan\Zotero\storage\638SB6JY\Meurice and Soares-Frazao - 2020 - A 2D HLL-based weakly coupled model for transient flows on mobile beds.pdf,,morphodynamics; dam-break; erodible bed; finite-volumes; HLL; transient flows,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Web-of-Science,a2dhllbasedweaklycoupledmodelfortransientflowsonmobilebeds,0.3249380886554718,0.6716266870498657,0.4025929272174835,0.24621854722499847,0.49335724115371704,0.257036030292511,0.9620041847229004,0.03089381940662861,0.013378617353737354,0.0874105840921402,0.9910005331039429,0.8649932742118835,0.7961267232894897,0.9710156917572021,0.6267521381378174,0.6090598702430725,0.19606396555900574,0.7208897471427917,0.8176022171974182,0.533145546913147,0.5097043514251709,0.363483190536499,0.12463856488466263,0.10132236033678055,0.5411397814750671,0.02701479010283947,0.02909075655043125,0.02673386223614216,0.9980505704879761,0.005641908384859562,0.03010033443570137,0.06371500343084335,0.9995777606964111,0.9906780123710632,0.6248946189880371,0.9102267026901245,0.7332131862640381,0.8845388889312744,0.06797851622104645,0.0152329346165061,0.4335167407989502,0.16491954028606415,0.15040279924869537,0.22329235076904297

This method consists of predictor and corrector stages. The predictor stage contains a parameter to control the numerical diffusion that is performed by utilizing limiters and Riemann invariant theory. The corrector stage recovers the balance conservation equation. In the first part, we solve numerically the one-dimensional equation for two-phase shallow granular flows over a fixed bed with irregular topography. In the second part, we consider the model equations for the bed-load sediment transport, the governing model equations consist of two components, specifically, a geophysical flows part and interstitial fluid. The sediment part is described by the Exner equation when the velocity can be considered to be the solid velocity, fluid velocity or a mean value of both of them.(c) 2022 Elsevier Masson SAS.

The developed numerical model is used to replicate several test cases of known experimental and approximate solutions. These cases include bed aggradation due to sediment overloading, bed degradation due to sediment shut-off, dam break flow over erodible bed and movable bump due to subcritical and transcritical flows. The results obtained are found to be excellent and free from oscillations near sharp gradient.

Five typical test cases were simulated by the coupled model and the numerical results agreed well with either the corresponding experimental data or the analytical solutions.

The model is based on applying the moment approach to the Shallow Water Exner model, making it possible to recover the vertical structure of the flow. This approach allows us to obtain a better approximation of the fluid velocity close to the bottom, which is the relevant velocity for the sediment transport. A general Shallow Water Exner moment model allowing for polynomial velocity profiles of arbitrary order is obtained. A regularization ensures hyperbolicity and easy computation of the eigenvalues. The system is solved by means of an adapted IFCP scheme proposed here. The improvement of this IFCP type scheme is based on the approximation of the eigenvalue associated to the sediment transport. Numerical tests are presented which deal with large and short time scales. The proposed model allows to obtain the vertical structure of the fluid, which results in a better description on the bedload transport of the sediment layer.",2021-09,2024-12-01 00:01:08,2024-12-01 00:35:59,,903-941,,3,30.0,,,,,,,,,,English,,,,,,,"Place: Office B, 9/F, Kings Wing Plaza2, No.1 On Kwan St, Shek Mun, NT, Hong Kong, 00000, PEOPLES R CHINA Publisher: GLOBAL SCIENCE PRESS Type: Article",,C:\Users\johan\Zotero\storage\SXGKZ68H\Garres-Diaz et al. - 2021 - Shallow Water Moment Models for Bedload Transport Problems.pdf,,sediment transport; finite volume method; hyperbolic system; moment approach; Shallow Water Exner model,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Web-of-Science,shallowwatermomentmodelsforbedloadtransportproblems,0.9992974400520325,0.5362527370452881,0.24013903737068176,0.220616415143013,0.30868959426879883,0.16501392424106598,0.10218661278486252,0.09851332008838654,0.044116485863924026,0.04444725438952446,0.1305280178785324,0.11980095505714417,0.25245797634124756,0.9793868660926819,0.5384352803230286,0.8854304552078247,0.7710645198822021,0.5375538468360901,0.9192420244216919,0.6474817395210266,0.40110594034194946,0.41624903678894043,0.9989596605300903,0.32103410363197327,0.14897339046001434,0.024539697915315628,0.004839118104428053,0.022350111976265907,0.735689103603363,0.7171604037284851,0.2578585147857666,0.016931159421801567,0.2065737396478653,0.022074386477470398,0.06187599524855614,0.10548665374517441,0.03439110517501831,0.8426690101623535,0.47690868377685547,0.004538431763648987,0.06810236722230911,0.6806663870811462,0.8822250962257385,0.8414351344108582

On the one hand, the equilibrium approach for the bedload transport assumes that the actual transport rate instantaneously adapts to the local flow features. The resulting system of equations, composed of the shallow water equations for the flow (SWE) and the Exner equation for the bed evolution, has been widely used to simulate bedload processes. These capacity SWE + Exner models are highly dependent on the setup parameters, so that the calibration procedure often disguises the advantages and flaws of the numerical method. On the other hand, noncapacity approaches account for the temporal and spatial delay of the actual sediment transport rate with respect to the capacity of the flow. The importance of assuming nonequilibrium conditions in bedload numerical models remains uncertain however. In this work, we compared the performances of three different strategies for the resolution of the SWE + Exner system under capacity and noncapacity conditions to approximate a set of experimental data with fixed setup parameters. The results indicate that the discrete strategy used to compute the intercell fluxes significantly affected the solution. Furthermore, the noncapacity approach can improve the model prediction in regions with complex transient processes, but it requires a careful calibration of the nonequilibrium parameters.",2021-07,2024-12-01 00:01:08,2024-12-01 00:01:08,,,,13,13.0,,,,,,,,,,English,,,,,,,"Place: ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND Publisher: MDPI Type: Article",,C:\Users\johan\Zotero\storage\DBLBXY6N\Martinez-Aranda et al. - 2021 - Comparative Analysis of HLLC- and Roe-Based Models for the Simulation of a Dam-Break Flow in an Erod.pdf,,Exner equation; erodible bed; conservative numerical schemes; dam-break waves; finite volumes; noncapacity bedload; transient morphodynamics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Web-of-Science,comparativeanalysisofhllcandroebasedmodelsforthesimulationofadambreakflowinanerodiblechannelwitha90supsupbend,0.9986327886581421,0.5378046631813049,0.6041896343231201,0.3149142563343048,0.4842405617237091,0.19551336765289307,0.5501903891563416,0.15067684650421143,0.01801171526312828,0.05894562974572182,0.1246214434504509,0.20478317141532898,0.39921459555625916,0.8461028337478638,0.24035923182964325,0.038457199931144714,0.024206161499023438,0.7782350778579712,0.451651006937027,0.5877860188484192,0.46093612909317017,0.40914079546928406,0.9997142553329468,0.2238857001066208,0.3832661211490631,0.01815951243042946,0.011846236884593964,0.012312326580286026,0.2801238000392914,0.02843603305518627,0.1973671317100525,0.14015962183475494,0.33747637271881104,0.4265156388282776,0.39659383893013,0.6424885988235474,0.04484790191054344,0.2106851041316986,0.2501335144042969,0.10706346482038498,0.5735440254211426,0.16572809219360352,0.11466560512781143,0.24844297766685486

Due to the coupling effect among tidal currents, waves, and sediments, an immense sandbar area evolved in the outer subaqueous delta, impeding the flood releasing during wet season, as well as salinity intrusion during the dry season. In this work, an unstructured-grid based morphodynamic model was proposed to simulate the sandbar evolution process in the Modaomen Estuary. The proposed model was constructed by using the two-dimensional shallow water equations for tidal flow, the advection-diffusion equations for salinity and suspended sediment transport, and the non-equilibrium formulation of the Exner equation for bed evolution. To simulate the wave-induced longshore currents in the Modaomen Estuary, an adaptive time-stepping approach was proposed to couple the unstructured-grid based Simulating WAves Nearshore (SWAN) model and the shallow flow model. An integrated solver is proposed for computing flow, salinity, and sediment transport fluxes simultaneously, and then the shallow water equations and advection-diffusion equations are jointly solved by a high-resolution, unstructured-grid Godunov method. Application of the model to the Modaomen Estuary, using calibrated parameter values, gives results comparable to the measured data. The butterfly shape of the sandbar in the Modaomen Estuary is considerably well simulated by the proposed model, which matches well with the measured topography.",2018-05,2024-12-01 00:01:08,2024-12-01 00:01:08,,,,5,10.0,,,,,,,,,,English,,,,,,,"Place: ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND Publisher: MDPI Type: Article",,"C:\Users\johan\Zotero\storage\HITGI6KA\Hu et al. - 2018 - An Unstructured-Grid Based Morphodynamic Model for Sandbar Simulation in the Modaomen Estuary, China.pdf",,Godunov method; morphodynamic model; Modaomen Estuary; Pearl River; sandbar simulation,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Web-of-Science,anunstructuredgridbasedmorphodynamicmodelforsandbarsimulationinthemodaomenestuarychina,0.8458250761032104,0.7791053056716919,0.8402469158172607,0.40286019444465637,0.46586617827415466,0.3724321722984314,0.9949208498001099,0.0007557941135019064,0.026888985186815262,0.01824057847261429,0.03102741204202175,0.032095544040203094,0.07796230167150497,0.9161050915718079,0.7892863750457764,0.6844621300697327,0.801501452922821,0.6750895380973816,0.9637085199356079,0.5915130972862244,0.5779758095741272,0.38117000460624695,0.0511774979531765,0.6085067987442017,0.6918097734451294,0.0420483723282814,0.046119749546051025,0.0678548812866211,0.8906751275062561,0.0031726828310638666,0.030559860169887543,0.2265269011259079,0.19034747779369354,0.2539997398853302,0.043568819761276245,0.47813665866851807,0.5225334167480469,0.13195426762104034,0.5322808027267456,0.0035312073305249214,0.8070808053016663,0.13011953234672546,0.23908275365829468,0.2343190312385559

The models under consideration are governed by the coupling between the shallow-water and the Exner equations. Since the PDE system turns out to be an hyperbolic system in non conservative form, ambiguities may occur as soon as the solution contains shock waves. To enforce a unique definition of the discontinuous solutions, we adopt the path-theory introduced by DalMaso, LeFLoch and Murat [18]. According to the path choices, we exhibit several shock definitions and we prove that a shock with a constant propagation speed and a given left state may connect an arbitrary right state.

The integrator allows for the exact balance of energy exchanges in space and time for vertical atmospheric motions by preserving the skew-symmetry of the non-canonical Hamiltonian formulation of the compressible Euler equations. The performance of the integrator is accelerated by a preconditioning strategy that reduces the dimensionality of the inner linear system. Here we reduce the four component velocity, density, density weighted potential temperature and Exner pressure system into a single equation for the density weighted potential temperature via repeated Schur complement decomposition and the careful selection of coupling terms. As currently formulated, the integrator is based on a horizontal-vertical spatial splitting that does not permit bottom topography. The integrator is validated for standard test cases for baroclinic instability and a non-hydrostatic gravity wave on the sphere and a rising bubble in a high-resolution planar geometry, and shows robust convergence across all of these regimes.

M.",A Semi-Coupled Model for Morphological Flow Simulation in River Bend,JOURNAL OF APPLIED FLUID MECHANICS,,1735-3572,10.36884/jafm.13.05.30842,,This paper presents a new efficient and robust numerical model for morphological flow simulation in river bends. The hydrodynamic model is developed by solving the two dimensional (2D) shallow water equations using a total variation diminishing (TVD) MacCormack predictor corrector scheme. The present TVD method is very simple and provides accurate results free from numerical oscillations near sharp gradient. The effective stresses are modeled by using a constant eddy viscosity model. The sediment transport model solves the Exner equation using a simple forward time and central space (FTCS) finite difference algorithm. The sediment transport model incorporates the helical flow and the transverse bed slope effects on the sediment direction computation. These models are coupled using the semicoupled approach. The present semicoupled model is used to replicate two popular experimental test cases of both tight and loose channel bends. The obtained results in terms of bed level variation reveal that the model can accurately simulate several features of the bed changes such as oscillations of the transverse bed profile with the formation of point bars and pools along the banks. The values obtained for three widely used statistical parameters show the applicability of the present model for this type of complex scenarios.,2020-09,2024-12-01 00:01:08,2024-12-01 00:01:08,,1611-1622,,5,13.0,,,,,,,,,,English,,,,,,,"Place: MECHANICAL ENGINEEING DEPT, JAFM OFFICE, ISFAHAN, 84156-83111, IRAN Publisher: ISFAHAN UNIV TECHNOLOGY Type: Article",,C:\Users\johan\Zotero\storage\3MQ25AZ9\Bora and Kalita - 2020 - A Semi-Coupled Model for Morphological Flow Simulation in River Bend.pdf,,Exner equation; Shallow water equations; Sediment transport model; FTCS scheme; Semicoupled model; TVD MacCormack scheme,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Web-of-Science,asemicoupledmodelformorphologicalflowsimulationinriverbend,0.5641517639160156,0.42408430576324463,0.6148510575294495,0.21652677655220032,0.3007652759552002,0.08073737472295761,0.9974862337112427,0.0005506685120053589,0.020275462418794632,0.033895451575517654,0.02730865404009819,0.27556487917900085,0.9798612594604492,0.9963376522064209,0.9887829422950745,0.9617865085601807,0.003771632444113493,0.7961058616638184,0.9515662789344788,0.42593914270401,0.6177397966384888,0.23257291316986084,0.10980118811130524,0.43947669863700867,0.7708100080490112,0.028007520362734795,0.020606474950909615,0.022759154438972473,0.9624619483947754,0.0031974867451936007,0.15941360592842102,0.034782394766807556,0.24104246497154236,0.837619960308075,0.6551154255867004,0.9991880059242249,0.8594279885292053,0.852014422416687,0.006400730926543474,0.05033063143491745,0.8248149752616882,0.24716882407665253,0.1755380779504776,0.29675617814064026

These conditions allow the generation of incident signals and the absorption of reflected ones, taking into account the bed evolution at the boundary. They use the approximations for linear waves in shallow water and are based on the solution of the Riemann Equations. The proposed technique is implemented in the fully-coupled hydro-morphodynamical numerical model of Briganti et al. (2012a). Firstly, the generation and absorption of single monochromatic waves are studied to quantify the error after the reflected wave exited the domain. In all cases the error is always small, giving evidence of the effectiveness of the new seaward boundary conditions. Furthermore, the propagation and reflection of a monochromatic wave train over a mobile bed are considered. Both flow evolution and bed change are not affected by spurious oscillations when long sequences of waves are tested. Additionally, a very low mobility bed is considered to simulate a `virtually fixed' bed and new boundary condition results consistently converge to those for the hydrodynamic only case. Finally, the reflection of a uniform bore over a mobile bed is studied. For this case the Rankine Hugoniot conditions provide an analytical solution. It is apparent that the adopted linear approximations produce errors in the velocity estimates. Nevertheless, the conditions perform reasonably well even in this demanding non-linear case.

The governing equations consist of the well-established shallow water system including bathymetric forces, friction terms, coriolis and eddy-diffusion stresses. To model sediment transport we consider an Exner equation for morphological evolution and an advection-diffusion problem for the transport of suspended sediments. As a numerical solver, we apply an adaptive finite volume method using a centred-type discretization for the source terms. The proposed method can handle complex topography using unstructured grids and satisfies the conservation property.

In particular, the Exner equation is taken into account either in the acoustic and transport steps, or only at the acoustic or transport level. The methods and their second-order extensions are designed in such a way to satisfy the well-balanced property, namely the “lake at rest” and the “constant bed slope” steady states.

The depth averaged shallow water equations (SWE) have been used to reach the flow pattern, the advection-diffusion equation (ADE) was exploited to determine sediment concentration in the water, bed load was determined by the active layer mass conservation equation (ALMC), while the morphological changes of the river bed were determined by the global active layer mass conservation equation (GALMC), the Exner equation. The SWE are solved by the multiple-relaxation-time lattice Boltzmann method, (MRT-LBM), while the Bhatnagar-Gross-Krook (BGK-LBM) approach has been used for solving the ADE, ALMC and GALMC. New forms of the equilibrium function for solving the ALMC and GALMC are presented, using the D2Q9 lattice. Dedicated sediment-related equations are created for each sediment-size class. Additional dedicated terms in the transport equations take care of particle exchange between the suspension and the river bed, as well as of river bed deformation. The model has been verified on a experimental section of the Danube river. The results have been compared to the measured ones, and to the results obtained by the finite difference method (FDM). Very good agreement between the results is achieved, indicating that the LBM can be successfully used for simulation of flow and sediment related processes in natural watercourses, characterized by complex geometry and morphology, and lack of uniformity in sediment composition.",2022-03,2024-12-01 00:01:08,2024-12-01 00:01:08,,,,,606.0,,,,,,,,,,English,,,,,,,"Place: RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS Publisher: ELSEVIER Type: Article",,,,Morphological changes; Sediment transport; Shallow water equations; Lattice Boltzmann method; Natural watercourses,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Web-of-Science,sedimenttransportandmorphologicalchangesinshallowflowsmodelledwiththelatticeboltzmannmethod,0.9353333115577698,0.7508385181427002,0.6047244668006897,0.2914671003818512,0.42496931552886963,0.4280001223087311,0.22793696820735931,0.08001924306154251,0.0069269719533622265,0.025097951292991638,0.04621452838182449,0.07030853629112244,0.30190086364746094,0.9907938241958618,0.9807704091072083,0.9489865303039551,0.0031563774682581425,0.7904701828956604,0.9820871353149414,0.5009902715682983,0.3381083607673645,0.2248915582895279,0.7060891389846802,0.18884700536727905,0.7844841480255127,0.08434180170297623,0.047074172645807266,0.032651375979185104,0.029340030625462532,0.004030743148177862,0.07963874191045761,0.08188609778881073,0.03194934502243996,0.028140751644968987,0.007968815043568611,0.9878996014595032,0.28402960300445557,0.760650634765625,0.002929241629317403,0.01587584801018238,0.974531888961792,0.08961381763219833,0.16184943914413452,0.3107989728450775

Numerical solution algorithms based on discontinuous Galerkin finite element discretizations of the model are proposed. The algorithms include both coupled and decoupled approaches for solving the hydrodynamic and morphodynamic parts simultaneously and separately from each other, respectively. The Strang operator splitting technique is employed to treat the dispersive terms separately, and it provides the ability to ignore the dispersive terms in specified regions, such as surf zones. Algorithms that can handle wetting-drying and detect wave breaking are presented. The numerical solution algorithms are validated with numerical experiments to demonstrate the ability of the algorithms to accurately resolve hydrodynamics of solitary and regular waves, and morphodynamic changes induced by such waves. The results indicate that the model has the potential to be used in studies of coastal morphodynamics driven by dispersive water waves, given that the hydrodynamic part resolves the water motion and dispersive wave effects with sufficient accuracy up to swash zones, and the morphodynamic model can capture the major features of bed erosion and deposition.

The present study investigates, using 2D shallow-water approximation, the morphodynamics and forces caused by a dam-break wave against a rigid obstacle in the presence of an erodible bed. A widely used coupled equilibrium model, based on the two-dimensional Saint-Venant hydrodynamic equations combined with the sediment continuity Exner equation (SVEM), is compared with a more complex two-phase model (TPM). Considering an experimental set-up presented in the literature with a single rigid obstacle in a channel, two series of tests were performed, assuming sand or light sediments on the bottom. The former test is representative of a typical laboratory experiment, and the latter may be scaled up to a field case. For each test, two different particle diameters were considered. Independently from the particle size, it was found that in the sand tests, SVEM performs similarly to TPM. In the case of light sediment, larger differences are observed, and the SVEM predicts a higher force of about 26% for both considered diameters. The analysis of the flow fields and the morphodynamics shows these differences can be essentially ascribed to the role of inertia of the solid particles.",2021-01,2024-12-01 00:01:08,2024-12-01 00:01:08,,,,2,13.0,,,,,,,,,,English,,,,,,,"Place: ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND Publisher: MDPI Type: Article",,C:\Users\johan\Zotero\storage\GCRD27W8\Di Cristo et al. - 2021 - Impact Force of a Geomorphic Dam-Break Wave against an Obstacle Effects of Sediment Inertia.pdf,,Exner equation; dam-break; mobile bed; impact force; two-phase model,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Web-of-Science,impactforceofageomorphicdambreakwaveagainstanobstacleeffectsofsedimentinertia,0.5407689809799194,0.4362063705921173,0.26878342032432556,0.19909502565860748,0.17139992117881775,0.2006080150604248,0.9978507161140442,0.0026779284235090017,0.010068343952298164,0.03470169007778168,0.0335722379386425,0.05589570850133896,0.168813094496727,0.3873152434825897,0.2328658401966095,0.30762964487075806,0.02289370819926262,0.2988860607147217,0.7621219754219055,0.23625341057777405,0.13718460500240326,0.06611456722021103,0.023197626695036888,0.039158374071121216,0.023153409361839294,0.019160708412528038,0.014281933195888996,0.01406362559646368,0.9989098310470581,0.003069387748837471,0.24481409788131714,0.060975175350904465,0.1932234764099121,0.022264916449785233,0.1579144448041916,0.007907291874289513,0.4233388304710388,0.22979436814785004,0.05712398141622543,0.011485952883958817,0.7467858791351318,0.17314834892749786,0.20394526422023773,0.2374875247478485

The model consists of the Saint-Venant system governing the water flow coupled with the Exner equation for the sediment transport. One of the main difficulties in designing good numerical methods for such models is related to the fact that the speed of water surface gravity waves is typically much faster than the speed at which the changes in the bottom topography occur. This imposes a severe stability restriction on the size of time steps, which, in turn, leads to excessive numerical diffusion that affects the computed bottom structure. In order to overcome this difficulty, we develop an operator splitting approach for the underlying coupled system, which allows one to treat slow and fast waves in a different manner and using different time steps. Our method is based on the application of a finite-volume central-upwind scheme introduced in [A. Kurganov and G. Petrova, Commun. Math.

The governing equations of this model include shallow water equations for the hydraulic behaviour, Exner equation for morphodynamic variations, and Grass model for solid discharge. The governing equations are formulated for the coupled approach. The problem is solved using EFG meshfree method, in which the problem domain is represented by a set of arbitrarily distributed nodes; there is no need to use meshes, elements, or any other node connectivity information for field variable interpolation. The EFG method is based on moving least-squares (MLS) shape functions originated in scattered data fitting. Finally, to assess the ability and the efficiency of the EFG method, several benchmark examples on regular and irregular distribution of nodes are investigated and the results are compared with those of previously published works.

To embody the advantages of the lattice Boltzmann method (e.g., simplicity, efficiency), the three-velocity (D1Q3) and five-velocity (D1Q5) doubledistribution-function lattice Boltzmann models (DDF-LBMs), which can present the numerical solution for one-dimensional bed-load sediment transport, are proposed here based on the quasi-steady approach. The so-called DDF-LBM means we use two distribution functions to describe the movement of the two components, respectively. By using the Chapman-Enskog expansion, the governing equations can be recovered correctly from the DDF-LBMs. To illustrate the efficiency of these, two benchmark tests are used, and excellent agreements between the numerical and analytical solutions are demonstrated.

The SVE system (SVEs) under some considerations, is a nonconservative hyperbolic system of nonlinear partial differential equations. This model is widely used in coastal engineering to simulate the interaction of fluid flow with sediment beds. It is well known that SVEs requires a robust treatment of nonconservative terms. Some efficient numerical schemes have been proposed to overcome the difficulties related to these terms. However, the main drawbacks of these schemes are what follows: (i) Lack of robustness, (ii) Generation of non-physical diffusions, (iii) Presence of instabilities within numerical solutions. This collection of drawbacks weakens the efficiency of most numerical methods proposed in the literature. To overcome these drawbacks a reformulation of the central-upwind scheme for SVEs (CU-SVEs for short) in a path-conservative version is presented in this work. We first develop a finite-volume method of the first order and then extend it to the second order via the averaging essentially non oscillatory (AENO) framework. Our numerical approach is shown to be well-balanced positivity-preserving and shock-capturing. The resulting scheme could be seen as a predictor-corrector method. The accuracy and robustness of the scheme are assessed a selected suite of tests.",2022-09,2024-12-01 00:01:08,2024-12-01 00:01:08,,359-384,,3,12.0,,,,,,,,,,English,,,,,,,"Place: PO BOX 33, YUSEONG, DAEJEON 305-600, SOUTH KOREA Publisher: TECHNO-PRESS Type: Article",,C:\Users\johan\Zotero\storage\I2VD88IS\Ndengna and Njifenjou - 2022 - A well-balanced PCCU-AENO scheme for a sediment transport model.pdf,,Saint-Venant-Exner model; AENO reconstruction procedure; path-conservative central-upwind scheme; sediment transport processes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Web-of-Science,awellbalancedpccuaenoschemeforasedimenttransportmodel,0.48420488834381104,0.5686550736427307,0.45312172174453735,0.29593467712402344,0.22663937509059906,0.4255419969558716,0.2623990774154663,0.11247987300157547,0.05607709661126137,0.10499024391174316,0.9678670763969421,0.31264686584472656,0.24580231308937073,0.9956747889518738,0.14692790806293488,0.3941754698753357,0.24176929891109467,0.7935444116592407,0.8874898552894592,0.620519757270813,0.31052035093307495,0.24005256593227386,0.2093888372182846,0.07935288548469543,0.6056824326515198,0.02076474018394947,0.011687259189784527,0.007039045915007591,0.19185705482959747,0.018653521314263344,0.07030383497476578,0.0685998722910881,0.7385748028755188,0.604836642742157,0.815232515335083,0.9989055395126343,0.01453152485191822,0.2230384200811386,0.15889085829257965,0.012821215204894543,0.12310183048248291,0.18242552876472473,0.07323097437620163,0.17546741664409637

The discretization of the bed slope source term is based on the HR method to preserve the still water steady-state solution. The hydrodynamic model described by the Saint-Venant system is numerically solved using the well-balanced unstaggered central scheme proposed in Dong and Li (2020). The morphodynamic model described by the Exner equation is numerically solved by using a Lax-Friedrichs method. In solving the morphodynamic model, we proposed a novel “cut-off” function to guarantee the nonlinear stability and preserve the stationary solution. The present scheme can exactly obtain the stationary solution and is capable of guaranteeing the positivity of the water depth. The key contributions of this work are the well-balanced property at the wet-dry fronts and the stability of the current scheme in solving two physical models that have relatively either strong or weak interactions.

Here, we study the basic mechanism that governs the evolution of topographic and expansions and explore the instability of the bottom topography under conditions of steady but spatially expanding flow. We model the expanding flow via a by configuration where water and sediments are supplied from a central hole and flow on a cone shaped surface confined by lateral walls. The governing equations are the shallow-water equations coupled with the Exner equation, written in cylindrical coordinates. We initially approach the problem analytically by considering the conditions required for the basic state, consisting of a pure radial flow and bottom profile, to lose stability to small amplitude perturbations. This analysis suggests that more than one mode may be unstable, encouraging us to extend the analysis to the nonlinear regime. We do this through numerical modeling of the full governing equations, which allows us to predict the establishment of a bar pattern whose features are similar to those experimentally observed. Two prominent features of the finite-amplitude bar pattern are (1) bar apices are distributed at a radial distance from the inflow consistent with work of Shaw et al. (2018); and (2) that the flow aspect ratio of the interbar areas remain high without provoking further instability. Both features imply that in general expansion acts to reduce bar development relative to an equivalent rectilinear flow.

The near-bed transport region is represented by the lower (bedload) layer which has an arbitrarily constant, vanishing thickness (of approx. 10 times the sediment particle diameter), and whose average sediment concentration is free to vary. Sediment is allowed to enter the upper layer, and hence the total load may also be simulated, provided that concentrations of suspended sediment remain low. The model conforms with established theories of bedload, and is validated satisfactorily against empirical expressions for sediment transport rates and the morphodynamic experiment of a migrating mining pit by Lee et al. (1993 J. Hydraul. Eng. 119, 64-80 (doi:10.1061/ (ASCE) 0733-9429(1993)119:1(64))). Investigation into the effect of a local bed gradient on bedload leads to derivation of an analytical, physically meaningful expression for morphological diffusion induced by a non-zero local bed slope. Incorporation of the proposed morphological diffusion into a conventional morphodynamic model (defined as a coupling between the shallow water equations, Exner equation and an empirical formula for bedload) improves model predictions when applied to the evolution of a mining pit, without the need either to resort to special numerical treatment of the equations or to use additional tuning parameters.",2018-02,2024-12-01 00:01:08,2024-12-01 00:01:08,,,,2,5.0,,,,,,,,,,English,,,,,,,"Place: 6-9 CARLTON HOUSE TERRACE, LONDON SW1Y 5AG, ENGLAND Publisher: ROYAL SOC Type: Article",,C:\Users\johan\Zotero\storage\W25JVE5J\Maldonado and Borthwick - 2018 - Quasi-two-layer morphodynamic model for bedload-dominated problems bed slope-induced morphological.pdf,,bedload; morphodynamics; bed slope; morphological diffusion,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Web-of-Science,quasitwolayermorphodynamicmodelforbedloaddominatedproblemsbedslopeinducedmorphologicaldiffusion,0.98775315284729,0.6806972026824951,0.1767982542514801,0.32716554403305054,0.373694509267807,0.44873037934303284,0.9980900287628174,0.00556977977976203,0.013154774904251099,0.03377726674079895,0.14661896228790283,0.2537241280078888,0.34872761368751526,0.46859315037727356,0.06617165356874466,0.48564624786376953,0.07267218828201294,0.3947630226612091,0.6265548467636108,0.5033271908760071,0.4576147794723511,0.35630637407302856,0.9979809522628784,0.07793767750263214,0.023087240755558014,0.0034834244288504124,0.002746901009231806,0.00286157988011837,0.9609882831573486,0.004142016638070345,0.23014025390148163,0.02161533199250698,0.12825192511081696,0.007162978872656822,0.015189049765467644,0.005957154091447592,0.621856689453125,0.7299531102180481,0.049176428467035294,0.0015761828981339931,0.024845434352755547,0.05525965243577957,0.04177388176321983,0.12262824922800064

For this purpose, a deviatoric version of the Saint Venant's equations is solved using the Beam and Warming implicit finite difference scheme. The Exner sediment continuity equation is solved using a simple finite difference scheme. The hydrodynamic and the sediment transport models are then coupled using the semicoupled approach. Due to the use of the deviatoric version of the governing equations, the model can efficiently handle the undulated river bed. Secondly, the present model can also use larger time step due to its implicit nature. Moreover, the implicit scheme is also iteration free and can smoothly handle transcritical flow regime. The model is tested in several test cases with bed slopes ranging from -0.244 to 0.086.

The equations are written in terms of potential temperature and Exner function. The time stepping is accomplished with the EPI2 and EPI3 schemes which have been used in the past for very accurate, long time step integration of the shallow water equations on the sphere. The stability of exponential integrators of this class is ensured by approximation of the oscillatory term using an absolutely stable exponential formula. Consequently, the schemes are not subject to the CFL condition imposed by the linear oscillatory part of the system and they also eliminate the phase errors associated with all the known implicit time stepping algorithms. All calculations are performed using the phipm algorithm based on the Krylov space methods. It is shown that the spectral radius of the Jacobian and consequently the Krylov space dimension are very sensitive to the presence of spatial noise. Efficiency and accuracy increase after the Shapiro filter is applied every two time steps. The method is investigated using several standardized and well accepted benchmark tests, including convective bubbles and a cold density current proposed by Straka and collaborators. Numerical experiments show that a stable integration is obtained for the wave Courant number of the order of 60 to 250. We present a detailed discussion of the development of a cold density current capturing the spiraling Prandtl vortex and the subsequent appearance of the Kelvin-Helmholtz billows. Our results from the exponential method compare very well with those obtained from the accurate schemes reported in the recent literature. The algorithm accurately handles both advection as well as acoustic and gravity waves. These results warrant the further development of the scheme for modeling atmospheric processes on a wide range of scales.

Its novelty lies in the magnitude of a viscosity term that leads to a momentum equation of elliptic type. The full model, sediment and water, verifies a dissipative energy balance for smooth solutions. The numerical resolution of the sediment layer is not trivial since the viscosity introduces a non-local term in the model. Adding a transport threshold makes the resolution even more challenging.

Complex interactions between tides, waves and shallow bathymetry often drive fast morphological changes but the underlying processes remain only partly understood. To better understand these processes, the development and application of morphodynamic models represents a unique perspective. This paper evaluates the impact of recent developments in the modelling system SCHISM, which include: a WENO method to solve the Exner Equation, a 3D coupling between waves and currents using a vortex force formalism, an adaptive parameterization for the dissipation of short waves by breaking and improved representations for wave-induced sediment transport. In order to evaluate the relevance of these developments, SCHISM is applied to the Maumusson Inlet, a mixed-energy inlet located on the Western Coast of France. Model-data comparison reveals firstly that complex wave-current interactions take place over the inlet ebb-delta, that include partial wave blocking during the ebb. Compared to classical 2DH approaches, our improved modelling system better reproduces the dynamics of adjacent beaches, inlet migration under oblique waves and sediment infilling of the main channel under storm waves. The relevance of these developments is demonstrated at the mixed-energy Maumusson Inlet (France).",2020,2024-12-01 00:01:09,2024-12-01 00:01:09,,1016-1020,,95,,,,,,,,,,,English,,,,,,,"Place: 5130 NW 54TH STREET, COCONUT CREEK, FL 33073 USA Publisher: COASTAL EDUCATION & RESEARCH FOUNDATION Type: Article",,,,sediment transport; morphodynamic modelling; Tidal inlet; wave-current interactions,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Web-of-Science,recentadvancesintidalinletmorphodynamicmodelling,0.6624763607978821,0.7547318935394287,0.474380761384964,0.8274585008621216,0.7291080951690674,0.5196340680122375,0.011439851485192776,0.06112290546298027,0.04428419843316078,0.3405226469039917,0.12808267772197723,0.209231436252594,0.5922759175300598,0.9422458410263062,0.015281608328223228,0.013025544583797455,0.9842835068702698,0.5635620355606079,0.9258975982666016,0.8212171792984009,0.6398773789405823,0.5293091535568237,0.01923425868153572,0.12199921160936356,0.3330150246620178,0.06424131989479065,0.03521113842725754,0.0204885546118021,0.021990222856402397,0.005080036353319883,0.033431366086006165,0.1782395839691162,0.22160324454307556,0.19072403013706207,0.14712579548358917,0.09203286468982697,0.027954399585723877,0.018959861248731613,0.9655439853668213,0.012007351033389568,0.7354991436004639,0.13223415613174438,0.18010665476322174,0.1591520458459854

The hydrodynamic model solves the three-dimensional shallow water equations (SWEs) using a finite volume method on prismatic cells in sigma-coordinates. The morphodynamic model solves an Exner equation consisting of bed-load sediment transportation. Using a relaxation approach, a hyperbolic system is built for hydrodynamic system, which allows for using a Godunov-type central-upwind method to capture the shocks and approximate the numerical fluxes. Consequently, the 3D-SWEs-Exner model proposed in the present study can stably and accurately solve the dam-break flows over mobile beds. A spatially and temporally second-order “prismatic” central-upwind method is used to approximate the numerical fluxes through cell interfaces. The Exner equation is solved using an upwind method. Using spatially linear reconstruction and explicit two-stage Runge-Kutta time discretization, second order accuracy is achieved in space and time. The proposed model can preserve the well-balanced property due to the special discretization of bed-slope source terms. The proposed model is validated by several tests with experimental measurements, and is compared with the simulated results using reported two-dimensional (2-D) models. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

In this framework we present a comparison between three different Dumbser-Osher-Toro (DOT) Riemann solvers. In particular, we focus on three different approaches to obtain the eigensystem of the Jacobian matrix needed to compute the fluctuations at the cell edges. For a general formulation of the bedload transport flux, we compute eigenvalues and eigenvectors numerically, analytically and using an approximate original solution for lowland rivers (i.e. with Froude number Fr << 1) based on a perturbative analysis. To test these different approaches we use a suitable set of test cases. Three of them are presented here: a test with a smooth analytical solution, a Riemann problem with analytical solution and a test in which the Froude number approaches unity. Finally, a computational costs analysis shows that, even if the approximate DOT is the most computationally efficient, the analytical DOT is more robust with about 10% of additional cost. The numerical DOT is shown to be the heavier solution.",2016,2024-12-01 00:01:09,2024-12-01 00:01:09,,699-706,,,,,,,,,,,CRC PRESS-BALKEMA,"PO BOX 11320, LEIDEN, South Holland, NETHERLANDS",English,,,,,,,Backup Publisher: Int Assoc Hydroenvironment Engn & Res; Soc Hydrotechnique France; Met Flow; HydroVision; Nortek B V; LaVsion Type: Proceedings Paper,,,,,,"Erpicum, S; Dewals, B; Archambeau, P; Pirotton, M",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Web-of-Science,comparisonbetweendifferentmethodstocomputethenumericalfluctuationsinpathconservativeschemesforsweexnermodel,0.8685914278030396,0.26106226444244385,0.3100720942020416,0.04481600597500801,0.011577990837395191,0.06853217631578445,0.21138142049312592,0.08855855464935303,0.022255215793848038,0.11655564606189728,0.042741794139146805,0.04868394508957863,0.0887802317738533,0.40775594115257263,0.14765696227550507,0.4393366575241089,0.03694882616400719,0.4415432810783386,0.3660975694656372,0.21122799813747406,0.10647930949926376,0.0794372707605362,0.9787939190864563,0.03368473798036575,0.7873594760894775,0.008046388626098633,0.009467379190027714,0.016705095767974854,0.15902140736579895,0.010189337655901909,0.15291562676429749,0.027350496500730515,0.09756222367286682,0.02711765468120575,0.21783627569675446,0.7217431664466858,0.0026939138770103455,0.7565374970436096,0.004573863931000233,0.008219693787395954,0.18884699046611786,0.08166610449552536,0.04522590711712837,0.14620910584926605

The transport of sediment by the flow assumes the sediment flux to remain in equilibrium with the local bed shear stress. Accordingly, the shallow-water hydrodynamic equations are coupled with the Exner equation for mass conservation of the sediment. The system of equations is solved using a fully coupled well-balanced finite volume method, second-order accurate in time and space. The effect of the steep bed slope of a dam face is incorporated into both the hydrodynamics and sediment transport equations, leading to improved predictions. Comparison with results obtained from nonequilibrium sediment transport models indicates that such models perform poorly while predicting the bed evolution near the toe of an eroding dam. Observations from experimental studies demonstrate that the amount of sediment entrained by the flow is not significant, except during the initial moments of failure. This suggests that the vertical exchange of mass between the bed and the flow layer, as assumed by the nonequilibrium models, may not be completely valid during the failure. The equilibrium model results, reproducing the key flow features of the overtopping failure process, are validated by experimental measurements. The study provides fresh insights into the sediment transport processes associated with the erosion of a granular dam by overtopping, establishes the appropriateness of the equilibrium approach for its numerical modeling, and proposes a well-balanced second-order accurate solution technique for solving the resulting coupled equations of flow and sediment transport.",2021-04,2024-12-01 00:01:09,2024-12-01 00:01:09,,,,4,33.0,,,,,,,,,,English,,,,,,,"Place: 1305 WALT WHITMAN RD, STE 300, MELVILLE, NY 11747-4501 USA Publisher: AMER INST PHYSICS Type: Article",,C:\Users\johan\Zotero\storage\5MY74M9U\Biswas et al. - 2021 - Equilibrium approach for modeling erosional failure of granular dams.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Web-of-Science,equilibriumapproachformodelingerosionalfailureofgranulardams,0.9072812795639038,0.5553746819496155,0.6965089440345764,0.3588429391384125,0.47899118065834045,0.5613212585449219,0.4049123525619507,0.153020977973938,0.1651107668876648,0.05574614554643631,0.977951169013977,0.8188144564628601,0.7305185198783875,0.9560866951942444,0.7299137115478516,0.9218991994857788,0.3735318183898926,0.6819576025009155,0.9847769737243652,0.5823816061019897,0.6341058611869812,0.5513904094696045,0.4245312213897705,0.3689739406108856,0.5249578952789307,0.015394916757941246,0.03810661658644676,0.025202825665473938,0.07640767097473145,0.006192990578711033,0.4400781989097595,0.032040078192949295,0.9933330416679382,0.687839686870575,0.17009402811527252,0.1792430579662323,0.2932526767253876,0.17795367538928986,0.21206879615783691,0.008694534189999104,0.9307735562324524,0.18616905808448792,0.2373991310596466,0.2958398759365082

The coupled method uses a coupling of the governing equations at the same time step leading to a non-conservative solution. The splitting method solves the Exner and the shallow water equations in a separate manner, and is only capable of modeling weak free-surface and bedload interactions. In the current study, an extended version of a Godunov-type wave propagation algorithm is presented for modeling of morphodynamic systems using both coupled and splitting approaches. In the introduced coupled method the entire morphodynamic system is solved in the form of a conservation law. For the splitting technique, a new wave Riemann decomposition is defined which enables the scheme to be utilized for mild and strong interactions. To consider the bedload sediment discharge within the Exner equation, the Smart and Meyer-Peter & Muller formulae are used. It was found that the coupled solution gives accurate predictions for all investigated flow regimes including propagation over a dry-state using a Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy (CFL) number equal to 0.6. Furthermore, the splitting method was able to model all flow regimes with a lower CFL number of 0.3.

The model is devised for compound channels modeling: cross-section overbanks are treated with fixed bed conditions, while the main channel is left free to modify its morphology. A capacitive approach is used for bed load transport modeling, in which the solid flow rates are estimated with bed load transport formulas. The model equations pose some numerical issues in the case of natural channels, where bed load transport may occur for both subcritical and supercritical flows and geometry varies in space. An explicit path-conservative scheme, designed to overcome all these issues, is presented in the paper. The scheme solves liquid and solid phases dynamics in a coupled manner, in order to correctly model near critical currents/channel interactions and is well-balanced, that is able to properly reproduce steady states. The Roe and Osher Riemann solvers are implemented, so as to take into account the spatial geometry variations of natural channels. The scheme reaches up to second-order accuracy. Validation is performed with fixed and movable bed test cases whose analytical solution is known, and with flume experimental data.

Comparison of Two Shallow-water Models against Laboratory Experiments: a Saint-Venant - Exner Classical Approach and a Two-layer Description,"PROCEEDINGS OF THE 35TH IAHR WORLD CONGRESS, VOLS I AND II",978-7-302-33544-3,,,,"Dam or dyke collapse constitutes a major danger for the surrounding inhabitants and infrastructures. Indeed, it induces a fast transient flow that may entrain large amounts of sediments and modify the valley morphology. The understanding of the interaction between such a rapid flow and the sediment transport remains a challenge for fluvial hydraulics. A combined approach of laboratory, theoretical and numerical modelling is still needed to predict the geomorphic consequences of a dam failure, mainly in a complex topography. A laboratory study of a dam-break wave expanding over a flat mobile bed in a floodplain was conducted in the Hydraulics Laboratory, Institute of Mechanics, Materials and Civil Engineering, Universite catholique de Louvain, Belgium. The flume was 3.6 m wide and about 36 m long. The rising gate featuring the dam break was 1 m wide, inducing a wave expanding longitudinally as well as transversally. An initial 85 mm layer of coarse sand was put down upon the fixed bed from 1 m upstream to 9 m downstream of the gate representing the dam. Two cases were simulated: (1) an initial water level of 47 cm above the fixed bed in the upstream reservoir and no water downstream; (2) an initial water level of 51 cm in the upstream reservoir and a water level of 15 cm downstream. Time evolution of the water level was measured at 8 points by means of ultrasonic gauges and the final topography was measured by a bed profiler every 5 cm. Only bed-load transport was observed in these experiments. This laboratory test was carried out as a benchmark experiment in NSF-Pire project (http://pire.ce.sc.edu/) and allowed two-dimensional (2D) numerical models from several authors to be analysed. Among these models, two shallow-water models are here compared in details. In the first model, a clear-water layer approach is used: the Saint-Venant-Exner (SVE) equations are solved, using a Manning formula for the friction source term and a Meyer-Peter-Muller closure equation based on an equilibrium solid transport assumption. The second model is a two-layer model (2L), where the flow is described along a vertical by three regions of homogeneous properties separated by sharp interfaces. The upper layer is made of clear water while the lower layer, standing for the bed-load transport layer, is a mixture of water and moving sediments. These layers flow over a motionless bed. Both models are solved on unstructured triangular meshes by a finite-volume scheme with a lateralized Harten-Lax-Van Leer (HLL) flux computation. Interesting conclusions may arise from comparisons between both models and comparisons with laboratory observations. The main features experimentally observed are captured by the numerical models. The water level evolution is better reproduced by the two-layer model than by the SVE model. The final deposition crests near the walls are still difficult to predict by both models.",2013,2024-12-01 00:01:09,2024-12-01 00:01:09,,4485-4494,,,,,,,,,,,TSINGHUA UNIV,"DEPT BUILDING SCI, SCH ARCHITECTURE, SECRETARIAT ISHVAC07, BEIJING, 100084, PEOPLES R CHINA",English,,,,,,,Backup Publisher: Minist Water Resources; China Inst Water Resources & Hydropower Res; Sichuan Univ; Tsinghua Univ; Univ Hong Kong; Chengdu Municipal Peoples Govt Type: Proceedings Paper,,,,Sediment transport; Finite volume; Dam-break flow; Mobile bed; 2D models,,"Zhaoyin, W; Lee, JHW; Jizhang, G; Shuyou, C",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Web-of-Science,2ddambreakflowsovererodiblefloodplaincomparisonoftwoshallowwatermodelsagainstlaboratoryexperimentsasaintvenantexnerclassicalapproachandatwolayerdescription,0.8048267364501953,0.7572184801101685,0.3652507960796356,0.25644779205322266,0.1740437000989914,0.4923532009124756,0.9788903594017029,0.09127191454172134,0.0060091628693044186,0.03320207819342613,0.765755295753479,0.4080202877521515,0.5445943474769592,0.8534141182899475,0.4474446475505829,0.817840576171875,0.02654954604804516,0.45518049597740173,0.3981959819793701,0.7246007919311523,0.3908962607383728,0.44968050718307495,0.9931095242500305,0.4369973838329315,0.10329549014568329,0.020725062116980553,0.010388216935098171,0.036117926239967346,0.9831175208091736,0.0007839424652047455,0.0468120314180851,0.106040820479393,0.9117313623428345,0.5880318284034729,0.0892956405878067,0.08897848427295685,0.11153118312358856,0.2812575399875641,0.0018639287445694208,0.011222868226468563,0.2189197540283203,0.10856642574071884,0.09009299427270889,0.10452301055192947

In order to numerically approximate such a system, we proceed step by step. We start by considering shallow water equations with non-constant density of the mixture water-sediment. Then, the Exner equation is included to take into account bedload sediment transport. Finally, source terms for friction, erosion and deposition processes are considered. Indeed, observe that the sediment particle could go in suspension into the water or being deposited on the bottom. For the numerical scheme, we rely on well-balanced Lagrange-projection methods. In particular, since sediment transport is generally a slow process, we aim to develop semi-implicit schemes in order to obtain fast simulations. The Lagrange-projection splitting is well-suited for such a purpose as it entails a decomposition of the (fast) acoustic waves and the (slow) material waves of the model. Hence, in subsonic regimes, an implicit approximation of the acoustic equations allows us to neglect the corresponding CFL condition and to obtain fast numerical schemes with large time step.",2023-11,2024-12-01 00:01:09,2024-12-01 00:01:09,,1087-1126,,4,16.0,,,,,,,,,,English,,,,,,,"Place: Office B, 9/F, Kings Wing Plaza2, No.1 On Kwan St, Shek Mun, NT, Hong Kong, 00000, PEOPLES R CHINA Publisher: GLOBAL SCIENCE PRESS Type: Article",,C:\Users\johan\Zotero\storage\3V4SBL52\Del Grosso et al. - 2023 - On Lagrange-Projection Schemes for Shallow Water Flows Over Movable Bottom with Suspended and Bedloa.pdf,,Shallow water flows; erosion-deposition processes; implicit-explicit schemes; Lagrange-projection schemes; movable bottom,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Web-of-Science,onlagrangeprojectionschemesforshallowwaterflowsovermovablebottomwithsuspendedandbedloadtransport,0.9971941113471985,0.9191740155220032,0.3836759924888611,0.23694850504398346,0.405009925365448,0.1852501779794693,0.23886260390281677,0.12259775400161743,0.003146188799291849,0.5471744537353516,0.03600004315376282,0.09073656052350998,0.10214894264936447,0.9959837198257446,0.3246909976005554,0.30261722207069397,0.7188853025436401,0.37572458386421204,0.7728574275970459,0.4557192027568817,0.4311210513114929,0.3472667336463928,0.9749407172203064,0.6146543025970459,0.6331267952919006,0.03803509473800659,0.005109737161546946,0.007907290942966938,0.510080873966217,0.044100914150476456,0.05618453770875931,0.04084571450948715,0.13805454969406128,0.38317957520484924,0.1203354075551033,0.9947391152381897,0.014309454709291458,0.5461632609367371,0.06383160501718521,0.004895880818367004,0.010818447917699814,0.210928812623024,0.10150035470724106,0.22034244239330292

The dynamics of surface waters is described by the Saint-Venant equations, taking into account the spatially inhomogeneous distribution of the terrain. The transport of sediment loads is described by the nonlinear Exner equation, generalized to the case of a spatially inhomogeneous distribution of the parameters of the underlying surface. For numerical integration of the Saint-Venant and Exner equations, a stable and well-tested CSPH-TVD method of the second order of accuracy is used, the parallel CUDA algorithm of which is implemented as the software package “EcoGIS-Simulation” for high-performance computing on supercomputers with graphics processor units (GPU). Hydrodynamic modeling of the processes of erosion of the enclosing dam of a real hydraulic facility and flooding of adjacent territories is carried out. The parameters of penetration of the enclosing dam and flooding zones, formed as a result of the development of a hydraulic accident at the tailing dump, are determined. Based on the obtained results, it is concluded that the proposed method for numerical modeling of the joint dynamics of surface water and traction sediment can be more universal and efficient (has significantly better accuracy and performance) compared to available methods for calculating the parameters of the washout and flood zones, especially for hydrodynamic flows with complex geometry on an inhomogeneous bottom relief.",2023-06,2024-12-01 00:01:09,2024-12-01 00:01:09,,261-272,,2,56.0,,,,,,,,,,English,,,,,,,"Place: PLEIADES HOUSE, 7 W 54 ST, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES Publisher: PLEIADES PUBLISHING INC Type: Article",,C:\Users\johan\Zotero\storage\Z2J7PILW\Khrapov - 2023 - Numerical Modeling of Hydrodynamic Accidents Erosion of Dams and Flooding of Territories.pdf,,parallel computing; shallow water; computational fluid dynamics; CSPH-TVD method; CUDA algorithm; dam washout and erosion; flood zones; mathematical modeling; Saint-Venant and Exner equations; tailing dump; traction sediment,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Web-of-Science,numericalmodelingofhydrodynamicaccidentserosionofdamsandfloodingofterritories,0.3952822685241699,0.3359887897968292,0.9979025721549988,0.9289656281471252,0.39008936285972595,0.4186622202396393,0.3292449712753296,0.05457348749041557,0.029910027980804443,0.009132247418165207,0.02913489378988743,0.0629376769065857,0.15188433229923248,0.9904233813285828,0.19523747265338898,0.9933283925056458,0.11338075995445251,0.8116061687469482,0.9665565490722656,0.5364655256271362,0.4755021631717682,0.5074508190155029,0.16118815541267395,0.10687688738107681,0.9951514005661011,0.9602867960929871,0.06530614197254181,0.04216654226183891,0.055412791669368744,0.0050211502239108086,0.029901405796408653,0.02571158856153488,0.08115489780902863,0.34466397762298584,0.05910154804587364,0.9788141250610352,0.025323061272501945,0.9755070209503174,0.01945657655596733,0.024492990225553513,0.8873022794723511,0.10150035470724106,0.07356304675340652,0.14463144540786743

Especially in the context of climate change, these defense structures are more prone to extreme hydraulic loadings. Inundation hazard and risk map inherently depend on the dominant form of failure progression. Breaching of earthen dams or embankments is a complex phenomenon that relies on various characteristics such as constituted soil, hydraulic load, regular maintenance, etc.In the frame of the 6th workshop on River and Sedimentation Hydrodynamics and Morphodynamics, a blind benchmark test concerning progressive dam failure due to overtopping was offered to modelers in order to evaluate and calibrate their models. The present paper only reports about the simulations done at UCLouvain, during the blind phase of the benchmark test. Two depth-averaged finite-volume models were applied to this benchmark test. While the first model (WCM) decoupled the shallow-water equations from Exner's one, leaving only weak links between the different operators, the second one (CM) solved them altogether. The WCM was able to reproduce most of the reservoir's water level evolution and is hence supposed to rather accurately predict the evolution of the breach width. Conversely, the CM led to faster erosion of the dam than expected, which led to a rapid decrease of the reservoir's water level. Meanwhile, a bank-failure operator is necessary to reproduce properly the widening of the breach. Three sediment transport formulas are used to observe their influence on the erosion rate of the embankment.",2022,2024-12-01 00:01:09,2024-12-01 00:01:09,,4292-4301,,,,,,,,,,,IAHR-INT ASSOC HYDRO-ENVIRONMENT ENGINEERING RESEARCH,"PASEO BAJO VIRGEN DEL PUERTO 3, MADRID, 28005, SPAIN",English,,,,,,,"Backup Publisher: Univ Granada; Minist Ecol Transit & Demog Challenge, Gen Directorate Coast & Sea; Minist Ecol Transit & Demog Challenge, Gen Directorate Water; China Inst Water Resources & Hydropower Res; Int Assoc Hydro Environm Engn & Res Type: Proceedings Paper",,,,overtopping; finite-volumes; breaching; dam-failure; Embankment dam,,"Ortega-Sanchez, M",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Web-of-Science,applicationofdepthaveragedbedloadfinitevolumemodelstoaprogressiveembankmentdamfailure,0.30337271094322205,0.39604341983795166,0.22894375026226044,0.47145530581474304,0.3964710831642151,0.41098934412002563,0.17819274961948395,0.05832551792263985,0.005356035195291042,0.06621519476175308,0.8258192539215088,0.40550488233566284,0.41802889108657837,0.7252219319343567,0.2231362760066986,0.8050540089607239,0.007711583748459816,0.6661925911903381,0.580661952495575,0.30995282530784607,0.35927245020866394,0.24359001219272614,0.010388215072453022,0.035880692303180695,0.41842955350875854,0.011029469780623913,0.01742575503885746,0.03004336729645729,0.12689334154129028,0.027585282921791077,0.11516223102807999,0.1420532763004303,0.9859634041786194,0.9025237560272217,0.5954043865203857,0.07316472381353378,0.03200981020927429,0.9872280955314636,0.003937738947570324,0.29614511132240295,0.8781053423881531,0.07204688340425491,0.08291986584663391,0.15215817093849182

Such numerical method may solve the proposed bedload sediment transport problem without the need to diagonalize the Jacobian matrix of flow. The numerical scheme uses a Runge-Kutta method with a fourth-order continuous natural extension for time discretization. The source term approximation is designed to verify the exact conservation property. Comparison of the numerical results for two accuracy tests have proved the stability and accuracy of the scheme. The results of the laboratory tests have also been used to calibrate different expressions of the solid transport discharge in the computer code. Two experimental tests have been carried out to study the erosive phenomenon and the consequent sediment transport: one test consisting of a triangular dune, and other caused by the effect of channel contraction.",2021-11,2024-12-01 00:01:09,2024-12-01 00:01:09,,,,6,3.0,,,,,,,,,,English,,,,,,,"Place: 111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA Publisher: WILEY Type: Article",,C:\Users\johan\Zotero\storage\L4YZLK4V\Capilla Roma et al. - 2021 - A high-order numerical method for sediment transport problems simulation and its comparison with lab.pdf,,central scheme; numerical-experimental contrast; sediment transport system,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Web-of-Science,ahighordernumericalmethodforsedimenttransportproblemssimulationanditscomparisonwithlaboratoryexperiments,0.9970353841781616,0.29069843888282776,0.438302606344223,0.10729890316724777,0.0295347161591053,0.023084983229637146,0.0004721255972981453,0.9978173971176147,0.02081632986664772,0.04239620268344879,0.9969928860664368,0.14028190076351166,0.022375421598553658,0.9838892221450806,0.41214221715927124,0.583984911441803,0.18596844375133514,0.3366594910621643,0.9937405586242676,0.3209529221057892,0.2692795991897583,0.09070637822151184,0.9743128418922424,0.16337868571281433,0.8782098293304443,0.022180039435625076,0.01319736149162054,0.013955709524452686,0.0030634168069809675,0.9986115097999573,0.6046615839004517,0.010189336724579334,0.9994296431541443,0.9548162817955017,0.13869492709636688,0.9991573095321655,0.011136502958834171,0.7552761435508728,0.010902374051511288,0.05948283523321152,0.9893062114715576,0.13603350520133972,0.12803374230861664,0.24689632654190063

A linked simulation-optimisation model is proposed for this purpose. The morphological flow simulation model was developed by solving the shallow-water equations and the Exner sediment continuity equation in a boundary-fitted coordinate system. The optimisation model was developed utilising a binary-coded genetic algorithm. The proposed model can automatically provide a cost-effective groyne series in terms of their number, length and position in any vulnerable channel bend. A constraint in terms of bend scour is also incorporated in the optimisation model, which allows the optimisation model to obtain the best groyne combination for no bend scour. To appraise the performance of the model, it was applied to a hypothetical vulnerable channel bend. The model produced the minimised cost of installation of the groyne system at that location, at the same time as making the location free from bend scour.",2021-08,2024-12-01 00:01:09,2024-12-01 00:01:09,,198-211,,4,174.0,,,,,,,,,,English,,,,,,,"Place: HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND Publisher: EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD Type: Article",,C:\Users\johan\Zotero\storage\NCRZC2G3\Bora and Kalita - 2021 - Best groyne series as countermeasure against river bend scour.pdf,,river engineering; hydraulics & hydrodynamics; mathematical modelling,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Web-of-Science,bestgroyneseriesascountermeasureagainstriverbendscour,0.13887235522270203,0.4318583607673645,0.41867032647132874,0.3285236060619354,0.4208175539970398,0.2749229669570923,0.18740054965019226,0.10877072066068649,0.21176786720752716,0.011619647033512592,0.26815953850746155,0.33472055196762085,0.5363818407058716,0.9463580250740051,0.6092076897621155,0.3998714089393616,0.30992239713668823,0.9046707153320312,0.9743145704269409,0.675847053527832,0.6186059713363647,0.5983248949050903,0.029145974665880203,0.19004665315151215,0.6187804341316223,0.01897803694009781,0.019606182351708412,0.07956718653440475,0.17809659242630005,0.01930808648467064,0.0420483723282814,0.02782202512025833,0.2024431973695755,0.3139454126358032,0.037151824682950974,0.7925445437431335,0.2779137194156647,0.4153730571269989,0.060252316296100616,0.022011233493685722,0.41232308745384216,0.1957477629184723,0.19102565944194794,0.3496992886066437

The pioneering study by Reynolds [1] showed that the standard Saint-Venant-Exner equations are unconditionally stable at subcritical Froude number. Hence, the use of depth averaged flow equations, which are commonly used by the hydraulic community, prevents the formation of bedforms as dunes. Recently, Ca (n) over tilde ada-Pereira & Bohorquez [2] have proposed a simple sediment transport formulation able to capture the formation of dune when coupled with the Saint-Venant equations. We replace the standard Exner equation with a non-equilibrium sediment transport equation that includes the following necessary ingredients: first, a phase shift in the particle entrainment rate; second, a particle diffusivity and an eddy viscosity. Subsequently, we solve the linear stability problem of an erodible-bed channel and show that the neutral curve properly captures the bed instability both in subcritical regime (i.e. dune) and supercritical flow (i.e. antidune and roll wave). Finally, we corroborate the capabilities of the model by means of non-linear numerical simulations which reproduce the growth of dune and antidune in agreement with experiments.",2018,2024-12-01 00:01:09,2024-12-01 00:01:09,,,,,40.0,,,,E3S Web of Conferences,,,,E D P SCIENCES,"17 AVE DU HOGGAR PARC D ACTIVITES COUTABOEUF BP 112, F-91944 CEDEX A, FRANCE",English,,,,,,,ISSN: 2267-1242 Type: Proceedings Paper,,C:\Users\johan\Zotero\storage\J78UG4Q7\Canada-Pereira and Bohorquez - 2018 - A simple non-equilibrium bedload transport equation for the formation of dune in a shallow-water flo.pdf,,,,"Paquier, A; Riviere, N",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Web-of-Science,asimplenonequilibriumbedloadtransportequationfortheformationofduneinashallowwaterflowoveranerodiblebed,0.34549054503440857,0.5878149271011353,0.41670435667037964,0.21147418022155762,0.3206537961959839,0.3261312246322632,0.1790759414434433,0.10448933392763138,0.008023779839277267,0.10353057831525803,0.05894674360752106,0.0983654335141182,0.2000550478696823,0.9213594198226929,0.13727517426013947,0.19196577370166779,0.19436058402061462,0.6815260052680969,0.9271267056465149,0.48580124974250793,0.3246615529060364,0.1770738661289215,0.45072197914123535,0.23607565462589264,0.18661333620548248,0.011115013621747494,0.006917241960763931,0.0032730649691075087,0.2568786144256592,0.036390893161296844,0.12929275631904602,0.03683870658278465,0.21304951608181,0.12517227232456207,0.20173455774784088,0.024214550852775574,0.249996155500412,0.14909721910953522,0.1678997427225113,0.0013537588529288769,0.6935248374938965,0.13061773777008057,0.11245381087064743,0.1766715943813324

The mathematical expression modeling the the hydrodynamic and morphodynamic components of the physical phenomenon are treated to deal with cross-section shape variations and empirical solid discharge estimations. The resulting coupled system of equations can be rewritten as a non conservative hyperbolic system with three moving waves and one stationary wave to account for the source terms discretization. But, even for the simplest solid transport models as the Grass law, to find a linearized Jacobian matrix of the system can be a challenge if one considers arbitrary shape channels. Moreover, the bottom channel slope variations depends on the erosion-deposition mechanism considered to update the channel cross-section profile. In this paper a numerical finite volume scheme is proposed, based on an augmented Roe solver (first order accurate in time and space) and dealing with solid transport flux variations caused by the channel geometry changes. Channel cross-section variations lead to the appearance of a new solid flux source term which should be discretized properly. Comparison of the numerical results for several analytical and experimental cases demonstrate the effectiveness, exact well-balanceness and accuracy of the scheme.",2018,2024-12-01 00:01:09,2024-12-01 00:01:09,,,,,40.0,,,,E3S Web of Conferences,,,,E D P SCIENCES,"17 AVE DU HOGGAR PARC D ACTIVITES COUTABOEUF BP 112, F-91944 CEDEX A, FRANCE",English,,,,,,,ISSN: 2267-1242 Type: Proceedings Paper,,C:\Users\johan\Zotero\storage\BAWKQURH\Martinez-Aranda et al. - 2018 - Coupled method for the numerical simulation of 10 shallow water and Exner transport equations in cha.pdf,,,,"Paquier, A; Riviere, N",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Web-of-Science,coupledmethodforthenumericalsimulationof10shallowwaterandexnertransportequationsinchannelswithvariablecrosssection,0.023705851286649704,0.2736639976501465,0.531049907207489,0.31926003098487854,0.09264067560434341,0.33520710468292236,0.0024987347424030304,0.9997394680976868,0.008286080323159695,0.12204577773809433,0.9880915284156799,0.18419718742370605,0.36968034505844116,0.9854254722595215,0.08424607664346695,0.9606104493141174,0.581164538860321,0.6414925456047058,0.9884240031242371,0.5473172664642334,0.4186016321182251,0.08833973109722137,0.07017629593610764,0.08021324872970581,0.6171953678131104,0.01250379253178835,0.011530389077961445,0.01890544965863228,0.01943795196712017,0.9976032972335815,0.20833994448184967,0.03155902028083801,0.9996639490127563,0.8182289600372314,0.08351588994264603,0.99318927526474,0.03138043358922005,0.24265404045581818,0.09964528679847717,0.013742320239543915,0.930962085723877,0.19860760867595673,0.039231929928064346,0.32949960231781006

Several negative aspects related to the lack of sediment supply were observed downstream many dams and the artificial replenishment of sediment was applied as a method to restore natural morphological conditions. The replenishment technique may be seen as a pulse of sediments added to the channel. Once the pulse-like volume of sediments is added into the reach, it is seen like an alteration of the channel geometry producing cross section narrowing and flow acceleration lengthwise the river. The river geometry modification together with the water flow allow erosion and transportation of the replenished material. In this work, the response of the flow to the material added in the channel is studied by means of the 2D shallow water equations model in combination with the Exner equation for the sediment continuity equation. Computational outcomes are compared with experimental data obtained from several replenishment configurations studied in the laboratory. It is observed how the bed fining provokes a larger spread of the material without aggradation within the armored channel.",2016,2024-12-01 00:01:09,2024-12-01 00:01:09,,1314-1320,,,,,,,,,,,CRC PRESS-BALKEMA,"PO BOX 11320, LEIDEN, South Holland, NETHERLANDS",English,,,,,,,"Backup Publisher: Int Assoc Hydro Environm Engn & Res; IIHR Hydroscience & Engn; Natl Great Rivers Res & Educ Ctr Alton; NSF; Amer Soc Civil Engineers, Environm & Water Resources Inst; Amer Soc Civil Engineers; AGU; Ven Te Chow Hydrosystems Lab; Saint Louis Univ; Sequoia Sci Inc; Sontek Type: Proceedings Paper",,,,,,"Constantinescu, G; Garcia, M; Hanes, D",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Web-of-Science,modelingsedimentpulsesonanarmoredchannel,0.12218136340379715,0.42212703824043274,0.3595576286315918,0.7252030372619629,0.5081743597984314,0.42718368768692017,0.9789268374443054,0.001071910373866558,0.007100122049450874,0.04653676226735115,0.023304935544729233,0.08662472665309906,0.2702443301677704,0.8465640544891357,0.6495321989059448,0.7391584515571594,0.003529103472828865,0.7724272608757019,0.7717075347900391,0.3260311186313629,0.3659643828868866,0.24890254437923431,0.8046362996101379,0.4044780433177948,0.31153157353401184,0.08725225180387497,0.00856089312583208,0.020371293649077415,0.9839553833007812,0.01958741806447506,0.09594075381755829,0.06928940862417221,0.2803700268268585,0.20521654188632965,0.08985312283039093,0.019475216045975685,0.7653303146362305,0.8429278135299683,0.01061142049729824,0.018440211191773415,0.6510776281356812,0.165121391415596,0.125600665807724,0.15456733107566833

The modelling system comprises the shallow water equations for the hydrodynamic behaviour and the Exner equation for the morphodynamic variations. These two systems of equations are then solved using a modified Godunov-type wave propagation method based on the coupled strategy which solves the entire coupled system in a fully hyperbolic conservative form. To maintain the hyperbolicity of the system, a well-known Grass-type bedload transport model is employed. First, the model is used to simulate parabolic sediment layer transportation over a flat bed. Next, the propagation of a sediment hump with a defined subcritical initial condition is considered. It will be shown that the proposed model provides a very good agreement with analytical or reference solutions even for the Courant number relatively close to 1 for the given test cases.",2015,2024-12-01 00:01:09,2024-12-01 00:01:09,,1904-1910,,,,,,,,,,,IAHR-INT ASSOC HYDRO-ENVIRONMENT ENGINEERING RESEARCH,"PASEO BAJO VIRGEN DEL PUERTO 3, MADRID, 28005, SPAIN",English,,,,,,,"Backup Publisher: Int Assoc Hydro Environm Engn & Res; Boskalis; Van Oord; UNESCO IHE; Delft Univ Technol; Deltares; Minist Infrastructure & Environm, Rijkswaterstaat; Royal HaskoningDHV; ARCADIS; WItteveen Bos; AANDERAA; Prince Sultan Bin Abulaziz Int Prize Water Type: Proceedings Paper",,,,Shallow water equations; Bedload sediment transport; Conservative fluxes; Flux-wave Approach,,"Mynett, A",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Web-of-Science,numericalmodellingofbedloadsedimenttransportdynamicsusingamodifiedfluxwaveapproach,0.9974364638328552,0.040486257523298264,0.2926279306411743,0.15369917452335358,0.11618819832801819,0.06839781999588013,0.030618298798799515,0.030952349305152893,0.016348468139767647,0.0018438657280057669,0.9971136450767517,0.32764050364494324,0.0843556597828865,0.748558521270752,0.009948013350367546,0.4911929965019226,0.19226233661174774,0.42655327916145325,0.8213514089584351,0.3832027316093445,0.18512867391109467,0.13310851156711578,0.9995818734169006,0.35142233967781067,0.7300493717193604,0.017442485317587852,0.02044939436018467,0.018546564504504204,0.2079375833272934,0.028409065678715706,0.421432763338089,0.02806073985993862,0.999789297580719,0.9000036716461182,0.11581064760684967,0.9863894581794739,0.08961381763219833,0.6953897476196289,0.1883239895105362,0.009974920190870762,0.673137903213501,0.20697419345378876,0.09113914519548416,0.30621573328971863

We begin by recalling the classical Saint-Venant or Shallow Water equations and present some extensions like the Saint-Venant-Exner model for bedload sediment transport. The first part is devoted to the derivation of several avalanche models of Savage-Hutter type, using a depth-averaging procedure of the 3D momentum and mass equations. First, the Savage-Hutter model for aerial avalanches is presented. Two other models for partially fluidized avalanches are then described: one in which the velocities of both the fluid and the solid phases are assumed to be equal, and another one in which both velocities are unknowns of the system. Finally, a Savage-Hutter model for submarine avalanches is derived. The second part is devoted to non-newtonian models, namely viscoplastic fluids. Indeed, a one-phase viscoplastic model can also be used to simulate fluidized avalanches. A brief introduction to Rheology and plasticity is presented in order to explain the Herschel-Bulkley constitutive law. We finally present the derivation of a shallow Herschel-Bulkley model.",2014,2024-12-01 00:01:09,2024-12-01 00:01:09,,51-106,,,3.0,,,,SEMA SIMAI Springer Series,,,,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",English,,,,,,,Backup Publisher: SEMA; SMAI; Univ Malaga; French Embassy Spain; Spanish Minist Econ & Competitiveness ISSN: 2199-3041 Type: Proceedings Paper,,C:\Users\johan\Zotero\storage\8NC6LLXG\Fernandez-Nieto and Vigneaux - 2014 - Some Remarks on Avalanches Modelling An Introduction to Shallow Flows Models.pdf,,,,"Pares, C; Vazquez, C; Coquel, F",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Web-of-Science,someremarksonavalanchesmodellinganintroductiontoshallowflowsmodels,0.354957640171051,0.5149444341659546,0.20055262744426727,0.19236312806606293,0.5933191776275635,0.4181385934352875,0.04796158894896507,0.4101180136203766,0.006594728212803602,0.06355719268321991,0.10188888758420944,0.11534509807825089,0.30782079696655273,0.8963972926139832,0.10913227498531342,0.18217185139656067,0.1615232527256012,0.3361634612083435,0.4114065170288086,0.3501722812652588,0.25464314222335815,0.32843267917633057,0.8614217042922974,0.15960998833179474,0.03832197189331055,0.006326630711555481,0.058292206376791,0.00545866135507822,0.02623034454882145,0.011244561523199081,0.08366550505161285,0.0445975735783577,0.20649373531341553,0.028194217011332512,0.07017630338668823,0.05899302661418915,0.003685674164444208,0.0501442477107048,0.008745182305574417,0.0023459072690457106,0.03102618083357811,0.18425323069095612,0.11308892071247101,0.13443464040756226

M.",Hydro-morphologic modelling for different calamitous scenarios in a mountain stream,RIVER FLOW 2014,978-1-4987-0442-7 978-1-138-02674-2,,,,"Analysis of different scenarios is addressed for the Mallero river, a mountain stream in northern Italy. A town (Sondrio) is present at the downstream end of the river. Flood hazard for Sondrio can be related either to flood events with significant sediment transport (because the in-town reach is a preferential location for aggradation processes with resulting increase of the water elevation) or to dambreak events (in case of collapse of a major landslide at relatively short distance upstream). Therefore, the manuscript explores the use of hydro-morphologic modelling to assess the level of hazard related with the scenarios for flood with intense sediment transport and for landslide and following dam-break wave. For the first scenario, a past event (flood of 1987) is considered, that has been already object of previous investigations. Propagation of the flood wave and resulting river morphologic changes are modelled using the coupled Saint-Venant and Exner equations. For the second scenario, different models are combined in an integrated process chain: available estimations of the landslide volume and models for dam breaching are used to create inflow conditions in terms of water and sediment discharge into the river, then the wave propagation is modelled again using the shallow-water, one-dimensional approach. For both scenarios, the analysis is devoted to assessing if these waves could be able to transport a significant amount of sediments to Sondrio, maximum elevation of the water surface and characterization of the time scales for the events. The role of analyses such as that presented here for territorial management and protection is discussed.",2014,2024-12-01 00:01:09,2024-12-01 00:01:09,,1603-1610,,,,,,,,,,,CRC PRESS-TAYLOR & FRANCIS GROUP,"6000 BROKEN SOUND PARKWAY NW, STE 300, BOCA RATON, FL 33487-2742 USA",English,,,,,,,"Backup Publisher: Swiss Fed Off Environm; BG Consulting Engineers; Hydro Exploitat SA; E dric ch; IM & IUB Engn; Basler & Hofmann; AquaVis Engn; Met Flow SA; Int Assoc Hydro Environm Engn & Res, Comm Fluvial Hydraul; Stucky; Groupe E; Patscheider Partner; HydroCosmos SA; Kissling Zbinden AG; Ribi SA; Poyry; Swiss Assoc Water Management; Ecole Polytechnique Federale Lausanne, Lab Hydraul Construct Type: Proceedings Paper",,,,,,"Schleiss, AJ; DeCesare, G; Franca, MJ; Pfister, M",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Web-of-Science,hydromorphologicmodellingfordifferentcalamitousscenariosinamountainstream,0.1506931185722351,0.3905845284461975,0.21327871084213257,0.3448692858219147,0.27258434891700745,0.6629207134246826,0.00255196844227612,0.9924545884132385,0.0100017711520195,0.031344760209321976,0.01629773899912834,0.020462654531002045,0.05002381652593613,0.2678203284740448,0.5819685459136963,0.9972176551818848,0.0009036317351274192,0.09803258627653122,0.33823511004447937,0.20665498077869415,0.3085877001285553,0.13101306557655334,0.029340028762817383,0.30985841155052185,0.2463066726922989,0.02136888913810253,0.024656854569911957,0.06483087688684464,0.14749377965927124,0.056288205087184906,0.013768816366791725,0.21958842873573303,0.19790910184383392,0.09594075381755829,0.08733006566762924,0.021105006337165833,0.39828944206237793,0.8904848694801331,0.005641908850520849,0.003350423416122794,0.15921740233898163,0.19360433518886566,0.1253863275051117,0.23970511555671692

The method employs an established augmented Riemann solver to compute unsteady, two-dimensional flows over arbitrary topography. An Exner equation is used to model the evolution of the bed using several common load formulas. The morphodynamic coupling is stabilized using an upwind approach. The scheme is implemented in a highly scalable block-structured adaptive mesh refinement framework. The resulting solver is well balanced and resolves the dry state while maintaining nonnegative depth. Idealized tests include comparison with exact Riemann solutions for dam break problems and an analytical solution for the migration of a one-dimensional sinusoidal bedform. Practical tests include the migration of a Gaussian perturbation and the evolution of flood and ebb shoals in a tidal inlet. The solver is benchmarked on a modern multiprocessor machine to quantify the scalability of the approach.",2013-05,2024-12-01 00:01:09,2024-12-01 00:01:09,,727-735,,3,29.0,,,,,,,,,,English,,,,,,,"Place: 5130 NW 54TH STREET, COCONUT CREEK, FL 33073 USA Publisher: COASTAL EDUCATION & RESEARCH FOUNDATION Type: Article",,C:\Users\johan\Zotero\storage\Z8VTDEJU\Cowles - 2013 - A Block-Structured Adaptive Mesh Refinement Solver for Morphodynamic Modeling.pdf,,shallow water equations; morphodynamics; Adaptive mesh refinement; wetting-drying,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Web-of-Science,ablockstructuredadaptivemeshrefinementsolverformorphodynamicmodeling,0.7600328922271729,0.573383092880249,0.9807374477386475,0.0210922509431839,0.012446315959095955,0.20909377932548523,0.9978874325752258,0.022951239719986916,0.0027596252039074898,0.011322583071887493,0.0035714157857000828,0.007944135926663876,0.008323421701788902,0.9607730507850647,0.32432034611701965,0.07294941693544388,0.02029353566467762,0.9217137098312378,0.9427141547203064,0.24694885313510895,0.1931738406419754,0.10643789917230606,0.7339765429496765,0.11853806674480438,0.9609516859054565,0.031232349574565887,0.0938439592719078,0.23048648238182068,0.999566912651062,0.0007733057136647403,0.011309891939163208,0.06584469228982925,0.0729663074016571,0.5143793821334839,0.027402503415942192,0.9894090890884399,0.7122321724891663,0.3460991382598877,0.3672986626625061,0.09113914519548416,0.7247728705406189,0.2477598488330841,0.10123348236083984,0.38217025995254517

We employ a 2-D numerical model based on the solution of the classical shallow water equations for the fluid phase coupled with the Exner equation and some semi empirical closure for the sediment transport rates. The model is applied to the case of a straight rectangular channel closed at the landward end and characterized by an initial plane bed, perturbed by randomly distributed disturbances of small amplitude. Numerical simulations have been performed for fixed values of the aspect ratio relatively close to the critical conditions of the linear theory. Preliminary results of our analysis show that bottom instability originates in the seaward part of the channel, giving rise to the formation of free alternate bars, with amplitudes decaying landward and wavelengths shorter than those predicted by the linear theory. Moreover, such features grow and migrate landward in time.",2008,2024-12-01 00:01:09,2024-12-01 00:01:09,,789-795,,,,,,,Proceedings and Monographs in Engineering Water and Earth Sciences,,,,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,"11 NEW FETTER LANE, LONDON EC4P 4EE, ENGLAND",English,,,,,,,Backup Publisher: IAHR Type: Proceedings Paper,,,,,,"DohmenJanssen, CM; Hulscher, SJMH",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Web-of-Science,ontheformationandmigrationoffreebarsinfinitetidalchannels,0.5624436140060425,0.2872585356235504,0.48195841908454895,0.2171916365623474,0.16876210272312164,0.056383512914180756,0.9997093081474304,0.0005687540979124606,0.004916336853057146,0.6363992094993591,0.5171312093734741,0.6710797548294067,0.546876847743988,0.973957896232605,0.009983665309846401,0.1908397227525711,0.36375683546066284,0.28918179869651794,0.9190168976783752,0.3524244725704193,0.20654556155204773,0.14110726118087769,0.23748749494552612,0.7446563243865967,0.03554439917206764,0.01219413336366415,0.004962942097336054,0.006564249284565449,0.9987791776657104,0.002491967985406518,0.06614567339420319,0.5964919328689575,0.11797801405191422,0.45222601294517517,0.15234725177288055,0.06960497051477432,0.4001046121120453,0.35314932465553284,0.14110378921031952,0.0029926651623100042,0.3075139820575714,0.2462613582611084,0.17852580547332764,0.26473838090896606

When these cyclones come closer to a coast, the sea level rapidly rises in the near shore region, where, the strong cyclonic winds blow towards the coast. This combined phenomenon can persist for few hours to few days which often become most destructive force as experienced in the past. This natural phenomenon known as storm surge can neither be modified nor prevented and it causes irreparable damage to life and property. The prediction of the magnitude of such cyclonic storm surges helps us to alert the disaster management personnel to articulate their activities and help the people in the coastal cities and villages to take necessary precautions. Shallow Water Equations (SWE) are the basic framework on which many real time predictions and mitigations of the aforementioned extreme hydrodynamic events could be explained and various approaches exist for solution of SWEs, mostly depending on the requirement of the problem In this paper, a hybrid Finite Volume (FV) and Finite Element (FE) based solver, which can efficiently use the depth adaptive unstructured gridding, is developed. The hybrid solver, is set up to simulate the real-time storm surge of cyclone Amphan, a Super Cyclone (SC), which made landfall over West Bengal coast, along east coast of India, on 20th May 2020. This cyclone was categorized as Very Severe Cyclonic Storm (VSCS) with wind speed close to 45 m/sand a moving wind speed of 7.5m/s approximately. Initially the model is calibrated and validated for a typical bathystrophic storm tide case and the hydrodynamic parameters like wind friction, bottom friction and eddy viscosity coefficients are attunedt The wind stress component of the calibrated numerical model is integrated with a semi-empirical cyclone model that is capable of reproducing the characteristics of cyclone Amphan. Such idealized cyclonic winds are validated with the real-time measured wind data and the final set up is used to predict the surge. The predicted surge due to cyclone Amphan, has been compared with the field measurements and the accuracy of the hybrid SWE model is evaluated.",2021-09,2024-11-19 23:54:29,2024-12-01 00:14:00,,1-8,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,ISSN: 0197-7385,,C:\Users\johan\Zotero\storage\57Y6Z2HY\Saichenthur and Murali - 2021 - Prediction of storm surge due to Super Cyclone Amphan using a Hybrid Finite Volume and Finite Elemen.pdf,,SWE; calibration; Extraterrestrial measurements; hydrodynamic parameters; Predictive models; Real-time systems; semi-empirical cyclone model; storm surge; Storms; super cyclone Amphan; Tropical cyclones; validation; Wind; Wind speed; coast modeling; 2D,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,IEEE,predictionofstormsurgeduetosupercycloneamphanusingahybridfinitevolumeandfiniteelementbasedswesolver,0.018894819542765617,0.41363754868507385,0.3661960959434509,0.3191669285297394,0.3070094585418701,0.33461540937423706,0.13475768268108368,0.03288642317056656,0.009483673609793186,0.010224428959190845,0.520404040813446,0.7584356665611267,0.40418946743011475,0.9809235334396362,0.013937142677605152,0.8705962300300598,0.7532320618629456,0.5799301862716675,0.9224016070365906,0.47999781370162964,0.3712645173072815,0.2283848226070404,0.008560892194509506,0.040237944573163986,0.845496416091919,0.024516336619853973,0.021267015486955643,0.02590801939368248,0.02239282801747322,0.004158160649240017,0.06542547047138214,0.12357701361179352,0.9182606339454651,0.57004714012146,0.009878941811621189,0.9788950085639954,0.001622967072762549,0.8043290972709656,0.9932811260223389,0.0326513834297657,0.43297719955444336,0.07765744626522064,0.08159290999174118,0.14922118186950684

The full hyperbolic system is written as two subsystems, namely the reduced system representing the slow dynamics and the boundary-layer system standing for the fast dynamics. By choosing the boundary conditions for the reduced system as zero, the slow dynamics is stabilized in finite time. The main result is illustrated with a design of boundary control for a linearized Saint-Venant-Exner system. The stabilization of the full system is achieved with different boundary conditions for the fast dynamics.",2014-12,2024-11-19 23:54:29,2024-12-01 00:13:52,,2840-2845,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,ISSN: 0191-2216,,C:\Users\johan\Zotero\storage\3DNGK3NU\Tang et al. - 2014 - Boundary control synthesis for hyperbolic systems A singular perturbation approach.pdf; C:\Users\johan\Zotero\storage\J87CZ4LW\Tang et al. - 2014 - Boundary control synthesis for hyperbolic systems A singular perturbation approach.pdf,,Sediments; Mathematical model; Equations; SWE-Exner; Boundary conditions; Perturbation methods; Stability analysis; Symmetric matrices,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,IEEE,boundarycontrolsynthesisforhyperbolicsystemsasingularperturbationapproach,0.006359228398650885,0.05430745705962181,0.08376488834619522,0.027830947190523148,0.00340169295668602,0.008747288025915623,0.06902867555618286,0.03408467024564743,0.05084092170000076,0.006741978228092194,0.005539337173104286,0.011853231117129326,0.0031436504796147346,0.023953059688210487,0.006342889275401831,0.004226003307849169,0.005351476836949587,0.04461159557104111,0.03501560539007187,0.03998912498354912,0.038805726915597916,0.005863781087100506,0.02515488490462303,0.03321116790175438,0.15228420495986938,0.01901443675160408,0.004503272473812103,0.0059687308967113495,0.6298030614852905,0.0629042387008667,0.4683232605457306,0.023109277710318565,0.13730095326900482,0.08913694322109222,0.08985312283039093,0.04922211170196533,0.0020911062601953745,0.00482972152531147,0.004046455025672913,0.00204276479780674,0.022328782826662064,0.18010666966438293,0.05108274146914482,0.21044158935546875

The proportional-integral (PI) control is proposed to study both the exponential stability and the output regulation of closed-loop systems with the aid of the Lyapunov approach. An explicit quadratic Lyapunov function as a weighted function of a small perturbation of the nonuniform steady-states of different channels is constructed. We show that by a suitable choice of the boundary feedback controls, the local exponential stability and the input-to-state stability of the nonlinear Saint-Venant equations for the H2 norm are guaranteed, then validated with numerical simulations.

The correct drying of the beans is one of the measures to contain this loss. As the grain mass is a set of solid and empty spaces, its drying could be considered a problem of the coupled open-porous medium. In this paper, a mathematical and computer simulation model was proposed, which describes the convection in a free flow with a porous obstacle applied to the drying of the grain. A computational fluid dynamics scheme was implemented in FORTRAN using Finite Volume to simulate and compute the numerical solutions. The code is parallel implemented using OpenMP and OpenACC programming interfaces. As a result, there was a significant reduction in processing time in both cases. The total simulation time was eight times less for a multicore architecture (16 physical cores) and 17.3 times using a single GPU (Quadro M5000).",2022-03,2024-12-01 00:13:45,2024-12-01 00:13:45,,181-188,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,ISSN: 2377-5750,,,,Computational modeling; Crops; Graphics processing units; High Performance Computing; Loss measurement; Mixing Layer; Multicore processing; Numerical Application; OpenACC; OpenMP; Programming; Solids,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,IEEE,parallelopenmpandopenaccmixinglayersimulation,0.081903375685215,0.44169557094573975,0.9772340655326843,0.7584508657455444,0.09510160982608795,0.7749477028846741,0.05344949662685394,0.030786054208874702,0.027611076831817627,0.16914841532707214,0.9656907320022583,0.5815111994743347,0.47293996810913086,0.8466140031814575,0.010766929015517235,0.011591494083404541,0.011067256331443787,0.8644869327545166,0.7899428009986877,0.5010831356048584,0.4822247624397278,0.3332350552082062,0.007876706309616566,0.012312326580286026,0.9542227387428284,0.4990806579589844,0.03374836966395378,0.26559463143348694,0.1674908548593521,0.06602513045072556,0.18884699046611786,0.05644402652978897,0.9737197160720825,0.36455124616622925,0.07204689085483551,0.9781771898269653,0.0015277629718184471,0.011288072913885117,0.0010063779773190618,0.13822895288467407,0.27968093752861023,0.12268079817295074,0.05160596966743469,0.22143486142158508

The modelling system consists of three coupled model components: (i) the shallow-water equations for the hydrodynamical model; (ii) a transport equation for the dispersion of suspended sediments; and (iii) an Exner equation for the morphodynamics. These coupled models form a hyperbolic system of conservation laws with source terms. The proposed finite-volume method consists of a predictor stage for the discretization of gradient terms and a corrector stage for the treatment of source terms. The gradient fluxes are discretized using a modified Roe's scheme using the sign of the Jacobian matrix in the coupled system. A well-balanced discretization is used for the treatment of source terms. In this paper, we also employ an adaptive procedure in the finite-volume method by monitoring the concentration of suspended sediments in the computational domain during its transport process. The method uses unstructured meshes and incorporates upwinded numerical fluxes and slope limiters to provide sharp resolution of steep sediment concentrations and bed load gradients that may form in the approximate solutions. Details are given on the implementation of the method, and numerical results are presented for two idealized test cases, which demonstrate the accuracy and robustness of the method and its applicability in predicting dam-break flows over erodible sediment beds. The method is also applied to a sediment transport problem in the Nador lagoon. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",2013,2024-11-21 21:06:47,2024-12-01 00:35:47,,967 – 993,,9.0,72.0,,,,,,,,,,English,,,,,,,Type: Article,,C:\Users\johan\Zotero\storage\6THLSF7D\Benkhaldoun et al. - 2013 - An unstructured finite-volume method for coupled models of suspended sediment and bed load transport.pdf,,Finite volume method; Sediment transport; Suspended sediments; SWE-Exner; finite-volume method; Bed-load transport; Shallow water equations; Unstructured grid; bed load transport; mesh adaptation; Nador lagoon; shallow-water equations; suspended sediment; unstructured grids; 2D; Numerical Method; FVM; Equations of motion; Hydraulics; Flow of water; Jacobian matrices; Numerical methods; Sedimentology; Lakes; Mesh adaptation,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,anunstructuredfinitevolumemethodforcoupledmodelsofsuspendedsedimentandbedloadtransportinshallowwaterflows,0.9974562525749207,0.5800464749336243,0.5776281952857971,0.41745826601982117,0.421184778213501,0.5574749708175659,0.9993197321891785,0.000668564229272306,0.036781713366508484,0.04321456328034401,0.9779536724090576,0.7176508903503418,0.6700745820999146,0.9919751882553101,0.24307161569595337,0.8863018155097961,0.38548678159713745,0.7137820720672607,0.9717215299606323,0.6012104153633118,0.5041605830192566,0.28136277198791504,0.9937587380409241,0.2546016275882721,0.7616271376609802,0.056861549615859985,0.013096004724502563,0.047514185309410095,0.9978801608085632,0.004943689331412315,0.30476540327072144,0.05839952081441879,0.9998639822006226,0.9207184314727783,0.5586881637573242,0.9997933506965637,0.037785764783620834,0.9451467394828796,0.7992073893547058,0.02161533385515213,0.8415654301643372,0.21255873143672943,0.17286889255046844,0.4264708459377289

The Exner equation is written assuming that bed-load transport is governed by a power law of the depth-averaged flow velocity and by a flow/sediment interaction parameter acting as a calibration coefficient. Uncoupled and coupled numerical resolutions of the global problem are considered. A Roe-type first-order upwind scheme has been applied as approximate Riemann solver for the discretization on 2D unstructured meshes. The uncoupled resolution is presented as a simple extension of a previous 2D shallow-water model. The details of the new implementation in the coupled system problem are provided. The models are tested comparing with exact solutions of 2D cases as well as experimental laboratory data.

The physical model is based on the shallow-water equations coupled with the Exner equation closed by the Grass model to describe the time evolution of the bed profile. The SRNH predictor-corrector scheme and a modified Roe scheme for non-conservative systems of equations are considered for space discretization. Second-order accuracy in space is achieved through variable reconstruction. These schemes were previously used in the simulation of the considered problems together with explicit time advancing. Linearized implicit time-advancing versions are generated here, in which the flux Jacobians are computed through automatic differentiation. Second-order accuracy in time is obtained through a backward differentiation formula associated with a defect-correction approach. For both the considered numerical methods, the explicit and implicit versions are compared in terms of accuracy and efficiency for one-dimensional and two-dimensional morphodynamic problems characterized by different time scales for the evolution of the bed and of the water flow. © 2013 IMACS.

To solve the coupled bed-load sediment transport terms using a Godunov-type central-upwind method, a novel scheme to estimate the bed-load fluxes which can produce more accurate results than the previously reported coupled model is proposed using a pair of local wave speeds different from those used for the flow. The two-dimensional shallow water equations are used to solve the flow velocities and water depth. The bed level is solved by an Exner-based equation containing bed-load sediment transport as numerical flux terms and sediment entrainment and deposition as source terms. Analytical formulas to compute the eigenvalues of the Jacobian matrix are developed.

The physical problem is modeled through the shallow-water equations coupled with the Exner equation to describe the time evolution of the bed profile. Different models of solid transport discharge of increasing complexity are considered. The spatial discretisation of the governing equations is carried out by a finite-volume method and a modified Roe scheme designed for non-conservative systems. Linearized implicit schemes for time advancing are built through a recently proposed strategy, based on automatic differentiation to compute the flux Jacobians and on the defect correction approach to reach second-order accuracy. Explicit schemes for time advancing are compared with implicit ones in one-dimensional sediment transport problems, characterized by different time scales for the evolution of the bed. It is shown that, independently of the model used for the solid transport discharge, for slow and intermediate speeds of interaction bewteen the bedload and the water flow, for which the use of large time steps is compatible with the capture of the bed evolution, implicit time advancing is far more efficient than explicit one with a computational cost reduction up to more than three orders of magnitude.",2012,2024-11-21 21:06:48,2024-11-21 21:28:51,,3736 – 3751,,,,,,,,,,,,,English,,,,,,,Type: Conference paper,,,,Finite volume method; Bed load; Sediment transport; Sedimentation; SWE-Exner; Shallow water equations; 1D; Numerical Method; FVM; Equations of motion; Automatic differentiations; Defect correction; Different time scale; Governing equations; Implicit schemes; Jacobians; Non conservative systems; Roe scheme; Second-order accuracy; Time evolutions; Time step; Water flows; Shallow waters; Bed evolutions; Computational costs; Computational methods; Discretisation; Electronic publishing; Explicit scheme; Implicit time advancing; Solid transport; Three orders of magnitude,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,implicittimeadvancingappliedtoshallowwaterproblemscoupledwithdifferentmodelsofsedimenttransport,0.9225153923034668,0.45722535252571106,0.6324828267097473,0.19801847636699677,0.16455776989459991,0.11709561198949814,0.0016971019795164466,0.9663535356521606,0.01914319396018982,0.05721047893166542,0.8001359701156616,0.28415000438690186,0.5152682065963745,0.9288423657417297,0.13653939962387085,0.1755134016275406,0.1550101935863495,0.6817371249198914,0.9331532120704651,0.4703265428543091,0.39077284932136536,0.23359081149101257,0.376651793718338,0.17412921786308289,0.8292155265808105,0.023509452119469643,0.011179600842297077,0.01619946025311947,0.046507950872182846,0.9379537105560303,0.163913294672966,0.02477455884218216,0.9526182413101196,0.8464508056640625,0.592401385307312,0.9763556718826294,0.007861458696424961,0.0070938607677817345,0.013480102643370628,0.01299541350454092,0.8163331747055054,0.15109041333198547,0.05639204382896423,0.15849970281124115

In this work, the numerical resolution has been implemented using improved and efficient versions of two different strategies for combining the hydrodynamical and morphodynamical components of the system. The first strategy is based on the full coupling of the flow and bedload transport equations (FCM), leading to a new formulation for the intercell numerical fluxes which includes the bed elevation into the resolution of the approximated local Riemann problem (RP) at the edges. The stability region of this method is controlled by the eigenvalues of the coupled Jacobian matrix at each intercell edge. On the second hand, an alternative decoupled strategy is considered based on solving independently the shallow water and the bed transport equations at each time step but controlling the stability region by means of an approximation of the coupled Jacobian matrix eigenvalues. This method, called approximate-coupled (ACM) allows simpler expressions for the numerical fluxes at the edges and ensures the stability of the scheme. Both strategies are based on the Finite Volume (FV) method using Roe's approach for the computation of the numerical fluxes between neighbouring cells and have been implemented into the same CPU-based numerical kernel in order to perform a realistic comparison of the range of applicability and computational efficiency. The ACM can only guarantee non-oscillatory results when the bed-flow interaction factor is small G≤O(10−3). If the interaction factor G is medium or high, G>O(10−2), the decoupled scheme loses its accuracy and robustness. Furthermore, for highly erosive flows the FCM scheme demonstrates to be more efficient in terms of computational effort than the ACM, one of the key points for large-scale and long-term bedload transport realistic applications. © 2021 The Author(s)",2021,2024-11-21 21:06:48,2024-12-01 00:02:07,,,,,153.0,,,,,,,,,,English,,,,,,,Publisher: Elsevier Ltd Type: Article,,C:\Users\johan\Zotero\storage\HH5F3YNA\Martínez-Aranda et al. - 2021 - Comparison of new efficient 2D models for the simulation of bedload transport using the augmented Ro.pdf,,Augmented Roe schemes; Bedload transport models; Efficiency and robustness; Hydro-morphodynamical coupled equations; Sediment transport; SWE-Exner; sediment transport; shallow-water equation; Bed-load transport; 2D; Numerical Method; FVM; ACM; FCM; bedload; Equations of motion; finite volume method; Jacobians; hydrodynamics; two-dimensional modeling; Jacobian matrices; morphodynamics; Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions; Numerical methods; Numerical flux; Augmented roe scheme; Bedload transport model; comparative study; Computational efficiency; Efficiency; efficiency measurement; erodibility; Hydro-morphodynamical coupled equation; Intercell; Stability regions; Transport equation,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,comparisonofnewefficient2dmodelsforthesimulationofbedloadtransportusingtheaugmentedroeapproach,0.9983973503112793,0.6310111284255981,0.959021270275116,0.08479230850934982,0.27497902512550354,0.8503414392471313,0.9717220067977905,0.0015940872253850102,0.060492172837257385,0.09563449770212173,0.9439091086387634,0.6683498620986938,0.5691930055618286,0.9924865365028381,0.22480365633964539,0.9362162947654724,0.3503535985946655,0.9092651009559631,0.9424468278884888,0.48288092017173767,0.3952101171016693,0.32364368438720703,0.998807430267334,0.020527789369225502,0.8580061793327332,0.001309605548158288,0.00999422650784254,0.09526525437831879,0.8891443610191345,0.0028173401951789856,0.08517511188983917,0.052230849862098694,0.9519972801208496,0.8054027557373047,0.27033573389053345,0.9974241256713867,0.10105592757463455,0.2767393887042999,0.34312158823013306,0.01742575690150261,0.10980119556188583,0.10114466398954391,0.06181931868195534,0.21052274107933044

The model is obtained by coupling the hydrodynamical component and the morphodynamical one. As our goal is to study coastal media, we chose the ShallowWater equations for the first component. For the other component the choice of the Exner law has been made using a function of the solid transport discharge, the Grass model. The coupled system of non linear partial differential equations is rewritten as a non-conservative hyperbolic system with source term that is solved by finite volume methods with flux limiters.

A novel approach is developed for the treatment of multiple sediment types in morphodynamics. The governing equations include the two-dimensional shallow water equations for hydrodynamics, an Exner-type equation for morphodynamics, a two-dimensional transport equation for the suspended sediments, and a set of empirical equations for entrainment and deposition. Multilayer sedimentary beds are formed of different erodible soils with sediment properties and new exchange conditions between the bed layers are developed for the model. The coupled equations yield a hyperbolic system of balance laws with source terms. As a numerical solver for the system, we implement a fast finite volume characteristics method. The numerical fluxes are reconstructed using the method of characteristics which employs projection techniques. The proposed finite volume solver is simple to implement, satisfies the conservation property and can be used for two-dimensional sediment transport problems in non-homogeneous isotropic beds without need of complicated three-dimensional equations. To assess the performance of the proposed models, we present numerical results for a wide variety of shallow water flows over sedimentary layers. Comparisons to experimental data for dam-break problems over movable beds are also included in this study. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.",2020,2024-11-21 21:06:48,2024-12-01 00:36:01,,474 – 497,,,88.0,,,,,,,,,,English,,,,,,,Publisher: Elsevier Inc.

In this article, previous work by the second author and several collaborators on the application and analysis of the DG method is extended to coupled shallow water/bed morphology dynamics, also called morphodynamics. Morphodynamic boundary value problems are used to simultaneously model shallow water hydrodynamics and sediment transport processes in estuarine and coastal systems. The governing equations of interest arise when the two-dimensional Saint-Venant equations are tightly coupled to the corresponding Exner equation. The tight coupling of these two processes presents numerous modeling and analytical challenges. The resulting nonlinear system is incompletely parabolic, and contains a nonconservative product. In this work, some of these analytical challenges are tackled by applying a local discontinuous Galerkin method to the morphodynamic system; the quantities of interest and their gradients are solved separately. A general, semidiscrete finite element formulation is presented, and after justifying some mild assumptions, a new a priori error estimate for the system is derived. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",2015,2024-11-21 21:06:48,2024-12-01 00:02:01,,397 – 421,,2.0,31.0,,,,,,,,,,English,,,,,,,Publisher: John Wiley and Sons Inc.

Simultaneous simulation of multiple physical processes requires a fully coupled system to achieve an accurate hydraulic and morphodynamical prediction. In this paper, we develop a high-order well-balanced finite-volume method for a new fully coupled two-dimensional hyperbolic system consisting of the shallow water equations with friction terms coupled with the equations modeling the sediment transport and bed evolution.The nonequilibrium sediment transport equation is used to predict the sediment concentration variation. Since bed-load, sediment entrainment and deposition have significant effects on the bed evolution, an Exner-based equation is adopted together with the Grass bed-load formula and sediment entrainment and deposition models to calculate the morphological process. The resulting 5. ×. 5 hyperbolic system of balance laws is numerically solved using a Godunov-type central-upwind scheme on a triangular grid. A computationally expensive process of finding all of the eigenvalues of the Jacobian matrices is avoided: The upper/lower bounds on the largest/smallest local speeds of propagation are estimated using the Lagrange theorem. A special discretization of the bed-slope term is proposed to guarantee the well-balanced property of the designed scheme. The proposed fully coupled model is verified on a number of numerical experiments. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.",2015,2024-11-21 21:06:48,2024-12-01 00:36:02,,202 – 218,,,300.0,,,,,,,,,,English,,,,,,,Publisher: Academic Press Inc.

The Exner equation is written assuming that bed load transport is governed by a power law of the flow velocity and by a flow/sediment interaction parameter variable in time and space. The complete system is formed by four coupled partial differential equations and a genuinely Roe-type first order scheme has been used to solve it on triangular unstructured meshes. Exact solutions have been derived for the particular case of initial value Riemann problems with variable bed level and depending on particular forms of the solid discharge formula. The model, supplied with the corresponding solid transport formulae, is tested by comparing with the exact solutions.

Despite its limitations, the Saint-Venant-Exner system is still (and for sure for some years) widely used in industrial codes to model the bedload sediment transport. In practice, its numerical resolution is mostly handled by a splitting technique that allows a weak coupling between hydraulic and morphodynamic distinct softwares but may suffer from important stability issues. In recent works, many authors proposed alternative methods based on a strong coupling that cure this problem but are not so trivial to implement in an industrial context. In this work, we then pursue 2 objectives. First, we propose a very simple scheme based on an approximate Riemann solver, respecting the strong coupling framework, and we demonstrate its stability and accuracy through a number of numerical test cases. However, second, we reinterpret our scheme as a splitting technique and we extend the purpose to propose what should be the minimal coupling that ensures the stability of the global numerical process in industrial codes, at least, when dealing with collocated finite volume method. The resulting splitting method is, up to our knowledge, the only one for which stability properties are fully demonstrated.

The model is based on the solutions of 2D shallow water equations coupled with the Exner equation. The bed load transport rate is calculated as an exponential function of depth-averaged flow velocity. To formulate a Godunov-type cell-centered finite volume method, the 2D domain is discretized using Cartesian cells. The HLL approximate Riemann solver is adopted, and a linear reconstruction is implemented to obtain values of conservative variables at cell edges. The model is applied to the 1D and 2D test cases. The model can satisfactorily reproduce the measured hydrographs and bed profiles for both dry bed and wet bed situations. © 2014 American Society of Civil Engineers.",2014,2024-11-21 21:06:48,2024-11-21 21:28:33,,1432 – 1441,,,,,,,,,,,American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE),,English,,,,,,,Type: Conference paper,,C:\Users\johan\Zotero\storage\GM32YC3F\Yu and Duan - 2014 - Two-Dimensional Finite Volume Model for Sediment Transport in Unsteady Flow.pdf,,Finite volume method; Sediment transport; Sedimentation; SWE-Exner; 2D shallow water equations; 2D; Numerical Method; FVM; Equations of motion; Linear reconstruction; Approximate Riemann solver; Flow velocity; Bed-load transport rate; Depth-averaged flows; Exponential functions; Finite volume model; Hydrographs; Two Dimensional (2 D); Water resources,,"W.C, Huber; W.C, Huber",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,twodimensionalfinitevolumemodelforsedimenttransportinunsteadyflow,0.9880000948905945,0.22466328740119934,0.21627546846866608,0.19204023480415344,0.21001888811588287,0.31686490774154663,0.9990890026092529,0.0006145659717731178,0.02470787614583969,0.003504425985738635,0.9794825315475464,0.06617449223995209,0.02537231519818306,0.7408379912376404,0.5044898986816406,0.2796233296394348,0.034881576895713806,0.33470070362091064,0.7792189121246338,0.42575889825820923,0.2401171177625656,0.25750523805618286,0.9963570833206177,0.17967446148395538,0.7767923474311829,0.023442290723323822,0.07049558311700821,0.09696200489997864,0.9998500347137451,0.0002251682453788817,0.23100648820400238,0.07450026273727417,0.9998686909675598,0.9838005304336548,0.09227795898914337,0.8169181942939758,0.04564946889877319,0.9905691742897034,0.027428539469838142,0.007246801629662514,0.5293850302696228,0.12759825587272644,0.14145922660827637,0.310433030128479

The shallow-water equations are solved first to calculate the full evolution of flow fields, and then the Exner equation is solved to model the morphodynamic response. The numerical method is based on a projection method, which consists in combining the momentum and continuity equations in order to establish a Poisson-type equation for water surface levels. The present formulation is identified as a semi-coupled approach because the projection method incorporates the change in the bed evolution in its approximation.

The mathematical formulation of these models consists of the shallow water equations for the hydraulics, an advection equation for the transport of sediment species, and an Exner equation for the bedload transport. The coupled problem forms a one-dimensional hyperbolic system of conservation laws with geometric source terms. The proposed numerical method combines the method of characteristics with a finite volume discretization of the system. The combined method is simple to implement and accurately resolves the governing equations without relying on Riemann problem solvers. Numerical results are presented for several test examples on sediment transport and bed morphology by free-surface water flows. © 2011 IMACS.",2011,2024-11-21 21:06:48,2024-12-01 00:02:07,,2073 – 2086,,10.0,81.0,,,,,,,,,,English,,,,,,,Type: Conference paper,,C:\Users\johan\Zotero\storage\FMITH7FT\Benkhaldoun and Seaïd - 2011 - Combined characteristics and finite volume methods for sediment transport and bed morphology in surf.pdf,,Finite volume method; Mathematical formulation; Sediment transport; Sedimentation; SWE-Exner; Bed-load transport; Shallow water equations; 1D; Numerical Method; FVM; Equations of motion; Hydraulics; Flow of water; Governing equations; Water flows; Numerical methods; Sedimentology; Numerical results; Method of characteristics; Bed morphology; Morphology; Hyperbolic system of conservation laws; Advection equations; Anoxic sediments; Combined method; Coupled problems; Finite volume discretizations; Finite volume schemes; Free surfaces; Riemann problem; Soil mechanics; Source terms; Surface morphology; Surface water flows; Surface waters; Test examples; Water wave effects; Finite volume scheme,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,combinedcharacteristicsandfinitevolumemethodsforsedimenttransportandbedmorphologyinsurfacewaterflows,0.9563565850257874,0.23478376865386963,0.5031952261924744,0.1596001237630844,0.16788873076438904,0.15618163347244263,0.0008468719897791743,0.9844224452972412,0.03158678114414215,0.029969558119773865,0.8714371919631958,0.22396516799926758,0.3083105683326721,0.9811453223228455,0.1057991161942482,0.6036360859870911,0.2295057326555252,0.7295308113098145,0.7746381759643555,0.24793140590190887,0.026593230664730072,0.11327739804983139,0.238905131816864,0.04845096543431282,0.676566481590271,0.012698200531303883,0.014785407111048698,0.011915022507309914,0.09130104631185532,0.9667574167251587,0.12049055844545364,0.022911690175533295,0.7951018214225769,0.09543373435735703,0.1357468068599701,0.9996892809867859,0.11721798777580261,0.773729681968689,0.3025971055030823,0.0042233653366565704,0.022371459752321243,0.09309922158718109,0.023621808737516403,0.09001296758651733

The physical problem is modeled through the shallow-water equations coupled with the Exner equation to describe the time evolution of the bed profile. The spatial discretization of the governing equations is carried out by a finite-volume method and a modified Roe scheme designed for non-conservative systems. As for the time advancing, starting from an explicit method, a linearized implicit scheme is generated, in which the flux Jacobian is computed through automatic differentiation. Second-order accuracy in space is then obtained through MUSCL reconstruction and in time through a backward differentiation formula associated with a defect-correction approach. The implicit time advancing is compared in terms of accuracy and computational time with the explicit approach for one-dimensional and two-dimensional sediment transport problems, characterized by different time scales for the evolution of the bed and of the water flow. It is shown that, whenever the use of large time steps is compatible with the capture of the water flow dynamics and of the bedload evolution, the implicit scheme is far more efficient than its explicit counterpart with a CPU reduction up to more than two orders of magnitude. This makes implicit time differencing an attractive option for complex real life applications in this area. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.",2012,2024-11-21 21:06:48,2024-12-01 00:02:18,,82 – 104,,,63.0,,,,,,,,,,English,,,,,,,Type: Article,,C:\Users\johan\Zotero\storage\DYVYV7VV\Bilanceri et al. - 2012 - Linearized implicit time advancing and defect correction applied to sediment transport simulations.pdf,,Finite volume method; Bed load; Sediment transport; Sedimentation; SWE-Exner; Shallow water equations; 2D; Numerical Method; FVM; Equations of motion; Hydraulics; Automatic differentiations; Backward differentiation formulae; Computational time; Defect correction; Defects; Different time scale; Explicit method; Flow of water; Governing equations; Implicit schemes; Jacobians; Linearization; Linearized implicit time advancing; Non conservative systems; Orders of magnitude; Real-life applications; Roe scheme; Second-order accuracy; Spatial discretizations; Time evolutions; Time step; Transport simulation; Water flows; Automatic differentiation,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,linearizedimplicittimeadvancinganddefectcorrectionappliedtosedimenttransportsimulations,0.997735857963562,0.5458060503005981,0.9783135652542114,0.1978507786989212,0.2105225771665573,0.5302384495735168,0.9782825112342834,0.12628041207790375,0.05063208192586899,0.06341429054737091,0.9747870564460754,0.5776739120483398,0.8589586019515991,0.9782781004905701,0.41519609093666077,0.2757280170917511,0.4906516671180725,0.8960082530975342,0.9440264701843262,0.515779972076416,0.534428060054779,0.4146120548248291,0.8040215373039246,0.049130793660879135,0.8689380288124084,0.03750274330377579,0.013376601040363312,0.02031290903687477,0.8359527587890625,0.09645017981529236,0.2792385220527649,0.03534407168626785,0.9494823217391968,0.8323729038238525,0.7725306749343872,0.9912378787994385,0.003922447096556425,0.023779986426234245,0.0586685948073864,0.04084571450948715,0.9671940207481384,0.17286890745162964,0.03387598320841789,0.29639965295791626

Governing equations consist of the shallow water equations and the Exner equation. The finite volume method on an unstructured triangular grid was deployed to discretize the governing equations. The local Riemann problem is solved by the Harten, Lax and van Leer-contact (HLLC) method in the interface of the cells and the equations are solved using a fully coupled method. Then the flux modelling has been deployed by the total variation diminishing (TVD) version of the weighted average flux (WAF) scheme. The model was verified by comparison of the results and available experimental data for dam-break flow, in a laboratory test, via a channel with sudden enlargement and erodible bed conditions. Comparison of these two sets of results shows that increasing the accuracy of flux modelling caused the model results to have a reasonable agreement with the experimental data. © 2015 IWA Publishing.",2015,2024-11-21 21:06:48,2024-12-01 00:02:08,,1155 – 1167,,7.0,72.0,,,,,,,,,,English,,,,,,,Publisher: IWA Publishing Type: Article PMID: 26398031,,C:\Users\johan\Zotero\storage\JCHS22QT\Hosseinzadeh-Tabrizi and Ghaeini-Hessaroeyeh - 2015 - Coupled dam-break flow and bed load modelling using HLLC-WAF scheme.pdf,,Finite volume method; Hydrodynamics; Sediment transport; SWE-Exner; shallow water equations; sediment transport; shallow-water equation; Shallow water equations; 2D; Numerical Method; FVM; bedload; Equations of motion; finite volume method; water flow; Governing equations; accuracy; accuracy assessment; analytic method; Article; calculation; computer program; controlled study; dam break flow; dam failure; experimental design; finite element analysis; flooding; Floods; flux measurement; Harten; HLLC method; hydrodynamics; laboratory method; laboratory test; Lax and van Leer contact method; mathematical model; Mobile bed; model validation; Models; river; shallow water; shear stress; Software; structural equation modeling; Theoretical; theoretical model; Total variation diminishing; TVD-WAF method; Two dimensional numerical models; two-dimensional modeling; volume; water; Water Movements; weighted average flux scheme; Weighted average fluxes; mobile bed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,coupleddambreakflowandbedloadmodellingusinghllcwafscheme,0.8790595531463623,0.9984187483787537,0.6347148418426514,0.26003122329711914,0.1059350073337555,0.22866500914096832,0.999168336391449,0.0005184410838410258,0.08172403275966644,0.10814189910888672,0.9963962435722351,0.5514425039291382,0.5801207423210144,0.996189534664154,0.38788318634033203,0.6636903285980225,0.14915059506893158,0.8495291471481323,0.9825360178947449,0.41814500093460083,0.4425918757915497,0.24368147552013397,0.6760320067405701,0.9896917939186096,0.7843190431594849,0.023779984563589096,0.023397618904709816,0.01707807183265686,0.9985162615776062,0.00015236754552461207,0.08210663497447968,0.05179748684167862,0.9950177073478699,0.93312668800354,0.18594719469547272,0.9819619655609131,0.002626552479341626,0.9954615831375122,0.06406542658805847,0.03138043358922005,0.9840630292892456,0.07592667639255524,0.07316472381353378,0.11787644028663635

The well-balanced finite volume WENO and lattice Boltzmann methods were implemented to solve nonlinear shallow water and Exner equations, respectively and a splitting strategy coupled those two solvers. This strategy was known to suffer from numerical instability due to loss of hyperbolicity, but this problem was not observed in the present method. To achieve advanced interaction between two solvers, cross-computation and information exchange were performed at every step of the high-order Runge-Kutta method. Extensive numerical experiments verified whether the present hybrid method was implemented correctly, and the proposed method provided satisfactory results of the well-balanced property, the accuracy, and the stability in verification examples. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",2022,2024-11-21 21:06:48,2024-12-01 00:02:16,,,,,265.0,,,,,,,,,,English,,,,,,,Publisher: Elsevier Ltd Type: Article,,,,Finite volume method; SWE-Exner; Exner equation; shallow-water equation; Finite-volume method; Shallow water equations; WENO; 2D; Numerical Method; FVM; LBM; Equations of motion; finite volume method; water flow; Runge Kutta methods; Numerical methods; Shallow flow; Well balanced; erodibility; Nonlinear equations; Erodible beds; Exn equation; computational fluid dynamics; Finite-volume; Hybrid meshes; instability; Kinetic theory; Lattice Boltzmann method; seafloor,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,hybridfinitevolumewenoandlatticeboltzmannmethodforshallowflowsovererodiblebed,0.0036188948433846235,0.09472616761922836,0.7031328082084656,0.12946133315563202,0.010543505661189556,0.07292860001325607,0.12788157165050507,0.08457230776548386,0.031528353691101074,0.056764159351587296,0.8991167545318604,0.01802636869251728,0.009037338197231293,0.9828726649284363,0.10759244859218597,0.9854187965393066,0.3670634329319,0.778763473033905,0.9537120461463928,0.18420085310935974,0.08140914887189865,0.06047043576836586,0.007303223479539156,0.026632413268089294,0.9297599196434021,0.008348053321242332,0.018038030713796616,0.021287351846694946,0.04142347350716591,0.00446838466450572,0.013045613653957844,0.019069159403443336,0.1750439703464508,0.01279651653021574,0.0016776672564446926,0.999231219291687,0.008711385540664196,0.9001793265342712,0.14792408049106598,0.010110844857990742,0.9954261779785156,0.04430721700191498,0.03120281919836998,0.11772420257329941

This coupling can be done if using a suitable Jacobian matrix. As a result, faithful numerical predictions are available for a wide range of flow conditions and empirical bed load discharge formulations, allowing to investigate the best option in each case study, which is mandatory in these type of environmental problems. When coupling the equations, the SWE are considered but including an extra conservation law for the sediment dynamics. In this way the computational cost may become unrealistic in situations where the application of the SWE over rigid bed can be used involving large time and space scales without giving up to the adequate level of mesh refinement. Therefore, for restoring the numerical efficiency, the coupling technique is simplified, not decreasing the number of waves involved in the Riemann problem but simplifying their definitions. The effects of the approximations made are tested against experimental data which include transient problems over erodible bed. The simplified model is formulated under a general framework able to insert any desirable discharge solid load formula. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.",2014,2024-11-21 21:06:48,2024-12-01 00:35:43,,93 – 109,,,71.0,,,,,,,,,,English,,,,,,,Publisher: Elsevier Ltd Type: Review,,C:\Users\johan\Zotero\storage\5J5EN66L\Juez et al. - 2014 - A 2D weakly-coupled and efficient numerical model for transient shallow flow and movable bed.pdf,,Finite volume method; Bed load; Sediment transport; SWE-Exner; Bed load sediment transport; Exner equation; 2D shallow water; sediment transport; shallow-water equation; Shallow water equations; 2D; Numerical Method; FVM; bedload; Equations of motion; finite volume method; numerical model; two-dimensional flow; water flow; 2D shallow waters; Concrete placing; Coupling techniques; discharge; Environmental problems; flow modeling; Jacobian matrices; Numerical efficiency; Numerical predictions; spatiotemporal analysis,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,a2dweaklycoupledandefficientnumericalmodelfortransientshallowflowandmovablebed,0.5203037858009338,0.9975877404212952,0.3818413019180298,0.24247732758522034,0.42677202820777893,0.3059914708137512,0.10962608456611633,0.08820880949497223,0.04959730803966522,0.04370305687189102,0.0669209435582161,0.16228339076042175,0.27036595344543457,0.9625272750854492,0.21078719198703766,0.5659885406494141,0.43220481276512146,0.7604741454124451,0.9655632376670837,0.38127103447914124,0.3835478127002716,0.22554337978363037,0.8556100130081177,0.989076554775238,0.7938261032104492,0.007785655092447996,0.004627529997378588,0.0030101987067610025,0.16715069115161896,0.006944126915186644,0.08487123250961304,0.009974920190870762,0.1489114761352539,0.5719160437583923,0.18198898434638977,0.9608415961265564,0.005070175044238567,0.7902067303657532,0.13632069528102875,0.01609087362885475,0.9824399948120117,0.054198723286390305,0.06518702954053879,0.12727250158786774

The governing equations comprise the shallow water equations (SWEs) for the hydrodynamic phase and the Exner equation for the estimation of bedload sediment transport. These sets of equations are then solved using a weakly coupled scheme based on an augmented Riemann solver (WCAR). In this approach, first, the morphodynamic equation is solved, and then, updated bedload changes with the same Riemann structures are used as a source term within the SWEs. The Smart formula is utilized to estimate the bedload sediment discharge within the Exner equation. The proposed numerical model is first used to model a parabolic sediment layer. Then, a bedload hump propagation with an initial subcritical condition is considered. Next, the simulation of dam-break flow over a mobile bed is investigated. Finally, the dam failure due to over-topping is studied and the computed results are compared with available experimental data. Numerical results indicate that the introduced weakly coupled method, developed based upon the augmented Riemann solver, can be effectively used for modeling all investigated flow regimes, including dry-state interfaces. © IWA Publishing 2019",2019,2024-11-21 21:06:48,2024-12-01 00:02:25,,834 – 850,,5.0,21.0,,,,,,,,,,English,,,,,,,Publisher: IWA Publishing Type: Article,,C:\Users\johan\Zotero\storage\Z9V8DJ8G\Barzgaran et al. - 2019 - Numerical simulation of bedload sediment transport with the ability to model wetdry interfaces usin.pdf,,SWE-Exner; 1D; Numerical Method; FVM; augmented Riemann solver; bedload sediment transport; Godunov-type wave propagation algorithm; weakly coupled method,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,numericalsimulationofbedloadsedimenttransportwiththeabilitytomodelwetdryinterfacesusinganaugmentedriemannsolver,0.9993499517440796,0.9946142435073853,0.8020760416984558,0.42618119716644287,0.6240137219429016,0.6192038059234619,0.24143224954605103,0.11605317890644073,0.053620968014001846,0.104625403881073,0.9974128603935242,0.7711779475212097,0.7642372250556946,0.9860771894454956,0.5168975591659546,0.914715588092804,0.41578924655914307,0.8034440875053406,0.9621137380599976,0.6048499941825867,0.4347727596759796,0.4411701560020447,0.9994966387748718,0.40136516094207764,0.8465777039527893,0.03908495232462883,0.04488975927233696,0.08079153299331665,0.08351588249206543,0.0056969597935676575,0.012241275049746037,0.04724971950054169,0.999473512172699,0.8003801703453064,0.11691518872976303,0.9990673661231995,0.06500871479511261,0.5086394548416138,0.038178276270627975,0.01638728380203247,0.9224823117256165,0.2179194688796997,0.13597612082958221,0.26530906558036804

This formulation is implemented by way of a discontinuous Galerkin (DG) finite element method, using a Roe Flux for the advective components and the unified form for the dissipative components. We implement a number of Runge-Kutta time integrators, including a family of strong stability preserving (SSP) schemes, and Runge-Kutta Chebyshev (RKC) methods. A brief discussion is provided regarding implementational details for generalizable computer algebra tokenization using arbitrary algebraic fluxes. We then run numerical experiments to show standard convergence rates, and discuss important mathematical and numerical nuances that arise due to prominent features in the coupled system, such as the emergence of nondifferentiable and sharp zero crossing functions, radii of convergence in manufactured solutions, and nonconservative product (NCP) formalisms. Finally we present a challenging application model concerning hydrothermal venting across metalliferous muds in the presence of chemical reactions occurring in low pH environments. © 2013.",2013,2024-11-21 21:06:48,2024-12-01 00:02:11,,95 – 110,,,59.0,,,,,,,,,,English,,,,,,,Type: Article,,C:\Users\johan\Zotero\storage\E7QM8DTA\Michoski et al. - 2013 - Fully coupled methods for multiphase morphodynamics.pdf,,Sediment transport; SWE-Exner; Shallow water; sediment transport; shallow-water equation; 2D; Numerical Method; FEM; Equations of motion; numerical model; hydrodynamics; Algebra; Discontinuous galerkin; equation; finite element method; Functions; Galerkin method; Galerkin methods; Geophysical flows; geophysics; Hot springs; hydrothermal vent; Hydrothermal vent; morphodynamics; Morphodynamics; multiphase flow; numerical method; Runge Kutta methods; Shallow waters; Discontinuous Galerkin; Geophysical flow,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,fullycoupledmethodsformultiphasemorphodynamics,0.05841534584760666,0.3413347005844116,0.4790685474872589,0.23177698254585266,0.07204464077949524,0.16099989414215088,0.9974390268325806,0.00026914189220406115,0.008205683901906013,0.023553641512989998,0.04430500045418739,0.9801802635192871,0.11402386426925659,0.995654284954071,0.13325706124305725,0.961658775806427,0.5244224071502686,0.43435218930244446,0.8833252787590027,0.346047580242157,0.39411696791648865,0.14145749807357788,0.03085050918161869,0.08441723883152008,0.8500956892967224,0.009708477184176445,0.01707807183265686,0.008429287001490593,0.8890480995178223,0.0006011794903315604,0.07343006134033203,0.027350494638085365,0.2680782675743103,0.9927952885627747,0.8478417992591858,0.9988486170768738,0.0009344576392322779,0.6334385871887207,0.6160411834716797,0.00391482375562191,0.17370831966400146,0.0753123089671135,0.1228911429643631,0.13432104885578156

Considering the fact that well-proven capacity formulae are based on one-dimensional (1D) experimental steady flows, the assessment of these empirical relations under unsteady 1D and 2D situations is important. In order to ensure the reliability of the numerical experimentation, the formulation has to be general enough to allow the use of different empirical laws. Moreover, the numerical scheme must handle correctly the coupling between the 2D shallow-water equations and the Exner equation under any condition. In this work, a finite-volume numerical scheme that includes these two main features will be exploited here in 1D and 2D laboratory test cases. The relative performances of Meyer-Peter and Müller, Ashida and Michiue, Engelund and Fredsoe, Fernandez Luque and Van Beek, Parker, Smart, Nielsen, Wong and Camenen and Larson formulations are analysed in terms of the root mean square error. A new discretization of the Smart formula is provided, leading to promising predictions of the erosion/deposition rates. The results arising from this work are useful to justify the use of an empirical sediment bed-load discharge formula among the ones studied, regardless of the hydrodynamic situation. © IWA Publishing 2013.",2013,2024-11-21 21:06:48,2024-12-01 00:02:20,,1234 – 1257,,4.0,15.0,,,,,,,,,,English,,,,,,,Publisher: IWA Publishing Type: Conference paper,,C:\Users\johan\Zotero\storage\SHPW9QCQ\Juez et al. - 2013 - Numerical assessment of bed-load discharge formulations for transient flow in 1D and 2D situations.pdf,,SWE-Exner; Exner equation; bed-load sediment transport; finite-volume method; smart bed-load formulation; two-dimensional shallow water; 2D; Numerical Method; FVM,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,numericalassessmentofbedloaddischargeformulationsfortransientflowin1dand2dsituations,0.44459810853004456,0.7384268641471863,0.42193490266799927,0.35729125142097473,0.424637109041214,0.46958163380622864,0.9990449547767639,0.10395382344722748,0.006431430112570524,0.09427253156900406,0.9742176532745361,0.6862009763717651,0.4977525472640991,0.9362947344779968,0.8495036363601685,0.7622109055519104,0.17065031826496124,0.6762721538543701,0.8924663066864014,0.49278223514556885,0.3907405734062195,0.26157382130622864,0.9641192555427551,0.06998536735773087,0.36296918988227844,0.01742575503885746,0.0290907584130764,0.02169809676706791,0.9989392161369324,0.010755924507975578,0.01729249395430088,0.06675146520137787,0.9935243129730225,0.30435171723365784,0.30709823966026306,0.2712034583091736,0.16545821726322174,0.8314854502677917,0.2065737545490265,0.26402613520622253,0.9092645049095154,0.053206197917461395,0.07772741466760635,0.1205940991640091

Those equations are solved in a coupled way by the first-order Godunov-type finite volume method. The Harten–Lax–van Leer–Contact (HLLC) Riemann solver is extended to find the local Riemann fluxes to maintain the exact balance between the momentum term and the bed slope term. A well-balanced scheme is superior to an unbalanced scheme to minimize numerical dispersion as demonstrated by the synthetic standing contact-discontinuity test case. Following this, the model is employed to simulate two laboratory experiments and a field case, the 1996 Lake Ha! Ha! flood event in Canada. The results of water surface elevations and bed surface profiles agree well with the measurements. The accuracy and robustness of the numerical schemes make the model a good candidate for practical engineering applications. © 2023 by the authors.",2023,2024-11-21 21:06:48,2024-12-01 00:02:25,,,,14.0,15.0,,,,,,,,,,English,,,,,,,Publisher: Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI) Type: Article,,C:\Users\johan\Zotero\storage\2JZB5ZLG\Duan et al. - 2023 - Numerical Simulation of Sediment Transport in Unsteady Open Channel Flow.pdf,,Finite volume method; Riemann solver; Sediment transport; Sedimentation; SWE-Exner; dam-break flow; sediment transport; shallow-water equation; Dam-break flow; Finite-volume method; Shallow water equations; 2D; Numerical Method; FVM; Equations of motion; Floods; Numerical methods; Balanced property; Canada; dispersion; flood; Godunov-type finite volume method; Harten–lax–van leer–contact riemann solv; Non-equilibrium sediment transport; Nonequilibrium sediment transport model; open channel flow; Open channel flow; Sediment transport modelling; unsteady flow; Variable density; Variable density shallow water equation; Well balanced; Well-balanced property; HLLC Riemann solver; nonequilibrium sediment transport model; variable density shallow water equations; well-balanced property,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,numericalsimulationofsedimenttransportinunsteadyopenchannelflow,0.8394643068313599,0.4855983853340149,0.4009544253349304,0.34530389308929443,0.20906537771224976,0.16272856295108795,0.9988008141517639,0.00020536758529487997,0.02784631960093975,0.03596958518028259,0.9344574213027954,0.07470133155584335,0.03912827745079994,0.7986869812011719,0.2881101369857788,0.9912479519844055,0.08218797296285629,0.5421240329742432,0.9539865851402283,0.31997770071029663,0.3311438262462616,0.19496698677539825,0.6947687864303589,0.1651887148618698,0.7306263446807861,0.022607609629631042,0.04130730405449867,0.01925269141793251,0.9988818764686584,0.00023322323977481574,0.19110113382339478,0.017392344772815704,0.9935494065284729,0.8684367537498474,0.2792384624481201,0.9242786169052124,0.02044939622282982,0.9687676429748535,0.009746103547513485,0.04863136634230614,0.9602867960929871,0.13939636945724487,0.16892549395561218,0.3203427493572235

Two different mathematical models were compared: a fully coupled formulation of shallow water equations with erosion and deposition terms (a depth-averaged concentration flux model), and shallow water equations with a fully coupled Exner equation (a bed load flux model). Both models were discretized using the cell-centered finite volume method, and a second-order Godunov-type scheme was used to solve the equations. The numerical flux was calculated using a Harten, Lax, and van Leer approximate Riemann solver with the contact wave restored (HLLC). A novel slope source term treatment that considers the density change was introduced to the depth-averaged concentration flux model to obtain higher-order accuracy. A source term that accounts for the sediment flux was added to the bed load flux model to reflect the influence of sediment movement on the momentum of the water. In a one-dimensional test case, a sensitivity study on different model parameters was carried out. For the depth-averaged concentration flux model, Manning's coefficient and sediment porosity values showed an almost linear relationship with the bottom change, and for the bed load flux model, the sediment porosity was identified as the most sensitive parameter. The capabilities and limitations of both model concepts are demonstrated in a benchmark experimental test case dealing with dam-break flow over variable bed topography. © 2017 Hohai University",2017,2024-11-21 21:06:48,2024-11-21 21:28:17,,287 – 294,,4.0,10.0,,,,,,,,,,English,,,,,,,Publisher: Editorial Office of Water Science and Engineering Type: Article,,C:\Users\johan\Zotero\storage\QW4DIUYQ\Zhao et al. - 2017 - Comparison of depth-averaged concentration and bed load flux sediment transport models of dam-break.pdf,,Finite volume method; Sediment transport; Sedimentation; Sediments; SWE-Exner; Shallow water equations; 2D; Numerical Method; FVM; Equations of motion; Shallow waters; Approximate Riemann solver; Computational fluid dynamics; Dam-breaks; Dams; Erosion and deposition; Flux model; Manning's coefficients; Porosity; Sediment transport model,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,comparisonofdepthaveragedconcentrationandbedloadfluxsedimenttransportmodelsofdambreakflow,0.662058413028717,0.9852185845375061,0.7187245488166809,0.3878629505634308,0.3158077895641327,0.17737120389938354,0.00032534266938455403,0.999362587928772,0.0013019917532801628,0.02869415283203125,0.6785992980003357,0.2922804653644562,0.32979074120521545,0.5867803692817688,0.2653931975364685,0.5999524593353271,0.13657523691654205,0.5640637874603271,0.8205900192260742,0.3815840780735016,0.4236052334308624,0.42746487259864807,0.12121684104204178,0.9680204391479492,0.8840392827987671,0.05155818536877632,0.04463920369744301,0.04153996333479881,0.008898884057998657,0.9164093732833862,0.15015338361263275,0.047691285610198975,0.9428234696388245,0.5306469798088074,0.2160942405462265,0.6816207766532898,0.026810195297002792,0.8540953993797302,0.2810601592063904,0.027376487851142883,0.6234055757522583,0.18242551386356354,0.16824111342430115,0.259450227022171

We propose a fully coupled method to simulate motion of wave-current-seabed systems and associated multiphysics phenomena. The wave action equation, the shallow water equations, and the Exner equation are respectively used for wave, current, and seabed morphology, and the discretization is based on a second-order, flux-limiter, finite difference scheme previously developed for current-seabed systems. The proposed method is tested with analytical solutions, laboratory measurements, and numerical solutions obtained with other schemes. Its advantages are demonstrated in capturing interplay among wave, current, and seabed; it has the capability of first-order upwind schemes to suppress artificial oscillations as well as the accuracy of second-order schemes in resolving flow structures. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.",2013,2024-11-21 21:06:48,2024-12-01 00:01:55,,1694 – 1709,,7.0,18.0,,,,,,,,,,English,,,,,,,Publisher: Elsevier B.V.

It is already several years since the single-layered models have been used to model shallow water flows over erodible beds. Although such models present a real opportunity for shallow water flows over movable beds, this paper is the first to propose a multilayered solver for this class of flow problems. Design/methodology/approach: Multilayered beds formed with different erodible soils are considered in this study. The governing equations consist of the well-established shallow water equations for the flow, a transport equation for the suspended sediments, an Exner-type equation for the bed load and a set of empirical equations for erosion and deposition terms. For the numerical solution of the coupled system, the authors consider a non-homogeneous Riemann solver equipped with interface-tracking tools to resolve discontinuous soil properties in the multilayered bed. The solver consists of a predictor stage for the discretization of gradient terms and a corrector stage for the treatment of source terms. Findings: This paper reveals that modeling shallow water flows over multilayered sedimentary topography can be achieved by using a coupled system of partial differential equations governing sediment transport. The obtained results demonstrate that the proposed numerical model preserves the conservation property, and it provides accurate results, avoiding numerical oscillations and numerical dissipation in the approximated solutions. Originality/value: A novel implementation of sediment handling is presented where both averaged and separate values for sediment species are used to ensure speed and precision in the simulations. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.",2020,2024-11-21 21:06:48,2024-12-01 00:35:50,,401 – 429,,2.0,37.0,,,,,,,,,,English,,,,,,,Publisher: Emerald Group Holdings Ltd.

The complete system of equations is made up of the energy balance law and the Exner equations. The numerical solution for this complete system is done in a segregated manner. First, the hyperbolic part of the system of balance laws is solved using a finite volume scheme. Three ways to compute the numerical flux have been considered, the Q-scheme of van Leer, the HLLCS approximate Riemann solver, and the last one takes into account the presence of non-conservative products in the model. The discretisation of the source terms is carried out according to the numerical flux chosen. In the second stage, the bed conservation equation is solved by using the approximation computed for the system of balance laws. The numerical schemes have been validated making comparisons between the obtained numerical results and the experimental data for some physical experiments. The numerical results show a good agreement with the experimental data. © 2021, Shanghai University.",2023,2024-11-21 21:06:48,2024-12-01 00:02:25,,885 – 922,,2.0,5.0,,,,,,,,,,English,,,,,,,Publisher: Springer Type: Article,,C:\Users\johan\Zotero\storage\EAUV6ZWL\González-Aguirre et al. - 2023 - Numerical Simulation of Bed Load and Suspended Load Sediment Transport Using Well-Balanced Numerical.pdf,,Finite volume method; Bed load; Sediment transport; Sedimentation; Suspended sediments; Numerical models; SWE-Exner; Numerical simulation; Finite-volume method; 1D; Numerical Method; Model Information; Equations of motion; Numerical methods; Balance law; Complete system; Conservation equations; Numerical flux; Numerical results; Numerical scheme; Suspended loads; Well- balanced schemes; Suspended load; Well-balanced schemes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,numericalsimulationofbedloadandsuspendedloadsedimenttransportusingwellbalancednumericalschemes,0.2365749478340149,0.33439943194389343,0.5333607196807861,0.3422735035419464,0.3470675051212311,0.3171004354953766,0.10577769577503204,0.06271659582853317,0.013006506487727165,0.05099425092339516,0.9761887192726135,0.5406770706176758,0.27470436692237854,0.9306262731552124,0.16474808752536774,0.9874678254127502,0.3362535536289215,0.7873575687408447,0.9863669276237488,0.41789257526397705,0.5136666893959045,0.35506895184516907,0.022158870473504066,0.024586498737335205,0.8166258335113525,0.008494837209582329,0.020567096769809723,0.047514185309410095,0.03149937838315964,0.00391482375562191,0.18417984247207642,0.022737445309758186,0.9323301911354065,0.6551154255867004,0.40718603134155273,0.9318355917930603,0.005448068957775831,0.6327580809593201,0.06773145496845245,0.010714440606534481,0.9577149748802185,0.08225394785404205,0.08181271702051163,0.18959611654281616

The bottom elevation change is evaluated using an excess shear-stress equation, which accounts for the hydrodynamic conditions and for the material characteristics. The proposed model modifies the local topography at runtime wherever the levee is overtopped without having to predefine the position and shape of the breach. The model is implemented in CUDA programming language, so that simulations can be run on graphics processing units, guaranteeing fast execution times even for high-resolution meshes and large domains. The validation is performed based on several experimental tests, and numerical predictions are in good agreement with the measurements. The strengths and weaknesses of the proposed approach are also discussed by comparison with a sediment transport model based on the Exner equation: While the latter gives good results only for breaches forming in levees built with noncohesive material, the proposed model can also be applied to cohesive embankments. The application to a historical flood event is also presented, showing that the model can effectively be employed for real field simulations also in the case of multiple breaches.",2019-01,2024-11-21 21:26:47,2024-12-01 00:02:17,,682-702,,1.0,55.0,,,,,,,,,,English,,,,,,,"Place: 2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA Publisher: AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION Type: Article",,C:\Users\johan\Zotero\storage\HBXJDIIM\Dazzi et al. - 2019 - Integration of a Levee Breach Erosion Model in a GPU-Accelerated 2D Shallow Water Equations Code.pdf,,Finite volume method; Sediment transport; SWE-Exner; shallow water equations; erosion; finite volume; flood simulation; GPU; levee breach; sediment transport; shallow-water equation; 2D shallow water equations; Shallow water equations; 2D; CUDA; Numerical Method; FVM; experimental study; Equations of motion; finite volume method; Floods; Two-dimensional shallow water equations; flood; Sediment transport model; Computer graphics; computer simulation; Embankments; Erosion; Flood simulation; Graphics processing unit; hardware; historical perspective; levee; Levee breaches; Levees; Material characteristics; Physically-based erosion model; Program processors; Shear stress; software; topography,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,integrationofaleveebreacherosionmodelinagpuaccelerated2dshallowwaterequationscode,0.05905088409781456,0.3512322008609772,0.9971424341201782,0.8905006647109985,0.40615031123161316,0.6312528848648071,0.9976387023925781,0.0004721372970379889,0.1000756025314331,0.07526562362909317,0.07344219833612442,0.23564982414245605,0.46163541078567505,0.9288371205329895,0.3002125024795532,0.1527549773454666,0.10324431955814362,0.521681010723114,0.9618886113166809,0.3498108685016632,0.4562363028526306,0.3078804314136505,0.04344690218567848,0.15856485068798065,0.9891396760940552,0.9923489689826965,0.13273923099040985,0.03517797589302063,0.9967013597488403,0.0004297173290979117,0.07450025528669357,0.10594827681779861,0.15437601506710052,0.8396682143211365,0.14396822452545166,0.9675331711769104,0.18787656724452972,0.5041741132736206,0.006513497792184353,0.02701479382812977,0.9300781488418579,0.35164496302604675,0.14282864332199097,0.47763028740882874

The mathematical expressions modeling the hydrodynamic and morphodynamic components of the physical phenomenon are treated to deal with cross-section shape variations and empirical solid discharge estimations. The resulting coupled equations can be rewritten as a non-conservative hyperbolic system with three moving waves and one stationary wave to account for the source terms discretization. Moreover, the wave celerities for the coupled morpho-hydrodyamical system depend on the erosion-deposition mechanism selected to update the channel cross-section profile. This influence is incorporated into the system solution by means of a new parameter related to the channel bottom variation celerity. Special interest is put to show that, even for the simplest solid transport models as the Grass law, to find a linearized Jacobian matrix of the system can be a challenge in presence of arbitrary shape channels. In this paper a numerical finite volume scheme is proposed, based on an augmented Roe solver, first order accurate in time and space, dealing with solid transport flux variations caused by the channel geometry changes. Channel cross-section variations lead to the appearance of a new solid flux source term which should be discretized properly. The stability region is controlled by wave celerities together with a proper reconstruction of the approximate local Riemann problem solution, enforcing positive values for the intermediate states of the conserved variables. Comparison of the numerical results for several analytical and experimental cases demonstrates the effectiveness, exact well-balancedness and accuracy of the scheme. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.
