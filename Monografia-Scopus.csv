The modelling system consists of three coupled model components: (i) the shallow-water equations for the hydrodynamical model; (ii) a transport equation for the dispersion of suspended sediments; and (iii) an Exner equation for the morphodynamics. These coupled models form a hyperbolic system of conservation laws with source terms. The proposed finite-volume method consists of a predictor stage for the discretization of gradient terms and a corrector stage for the treatment of source terms. The gradient fluxes are discretized using a modified Roe's scheme using the sign of the Jacobian matrix in the coupled system. A well-balanced discretization is used for the treatment of source terms. In this paper, we also employ an adaptive procedure in the finite-volume method by monitoring the concentration of suspended sediments in the computational domain during its transport process. The method uses unstructured meshes and incorporates upwinded numerical fluxes and slope limiters to provide sharp resolution of steep sediment concentrations and bed load gradients that may form in the approximate solutions. Details are given on the implementation of the method, and numerical results are presented for two idealized test cases, which demonstrate the accuracy and robustness of the method and its applicability in predicting dam-break flows over erodible sediment beds. The method is also applied to a sediment transport problem in the Nador lagoon. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","2013","2024-11-21 21:06:47","2024-11-21 21:06:47","","967 – 993","","9","72","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","Bed-load transport; Equations of motion; Finite volume method; Flow of water; Hydraulics; Jacobian matrices; Lakes; Mesh adaptation; Nador lagoon; Numerical methods; Sediment transport; Sedimentology; Shallow water equations; Suspended sediments; Unstructured grid","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this work, the numerical resolution has been implemented using improved and efficient versions of two different strategies for combining the hydrodynamical and morphodynamical components of the system. The first strategy is based on the full coupling of the flow and bedload transport equations (FCM), leading to a new formulation for the intercell numerical fluxes which includes the bed elevation into the resolution of the approximated local Riemann problem (RP) at the edges. The stability region of this method is controlled by the eigenvalues of the coupled Jacobian matrix at each intercell edge. On the second hand, an alternative decoupled strategy is considered based on solving independently the shallow water and the bed transport equations at each time step but controlling the stability region by means of an approximation of the coupled Jacobian matrix eigenvalues. This method, called approximate-coupled (ACM) allows simpler expressions for the numerical fluxes at the edges and ensures the stability of the scheme. Both strategies are based on the Finite Volume (FV) method using Roe's approach for the computation of the numerical fluxes between neighbouring cells and have been implemented into the same CPU-based numerical kernel in order to perform a realistic comparison of the range of applicability and computational efficiency. The ACM can only guarantee non-oscillatory results when the bed-flow interaction factor is small G≤O(10−3). If the interaction factor G is medium or high, G>O(10−2), the decoupled scheme loses its accuracy and robustness. Furthermore, for highly erosive flows the FCM scheme demonstrates to be more efficient in terms of computational effort than the ACM, one of the key points for large-scale and long-term bedload transport realistic applications. © 2021 The Author(s)","2021","2024-11-21 21:06:48","2024-11-21 21:06:48","","","","","153","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Publisher: Elsevier Ltd Type: Article","","","","Augmented roe scheme; Bed-load transport; bedload; Bedload transport model; comparative study; Computational efficiency; Efficiency; Efficiency and robustness; efficiency measurement; Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions; Equations of motion; erodibility; finite volume method; Hydro-morphodynamical coupled equation; hydrodynamics; Intercell; Jacobian matrices; Jacobians; morphodynamics; Numerical flux; Numerical methods; sediment transport; Sediment transport; shallow-water equation; Stability regions; Transport equation; two-dimensional modeling","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Multilayer sedimentary beds are formed of different erodible soils with sediment properties and new exchange conditions between the bed layers are developed for the model.

The mathematical expressions modeling the hydrodynamic and morphodynamic components of the physical phenomenon are treated to deal with cross-section shape variations and empirical solid discharge estimations. The resulting coupled equations can be rewritten as a non-conservative hyperbolic system with three moving waves and one stationary wave to account for the source terms discretization. Moreover, the wave celerities for the coupled morpho-hydrodyamical system depend on the erosion-deposition mechanism selected to update the channel cross-section profile. This influence is incorporated into the system solution by means of a new parameter related to the channel bottom variation celerity. Special interest is put to show that, even for the simplest solid transport models as the Grass law, to find a linearized Jacobian matrix of the system can be a challenge in presence of arbitrary shape channels. In this paper a numerical finite volume scheme is proposed, based on an augmented Roe solver, first order accurate in time and space, dealing with solid transport flux variations caused by the channel geometry changes. Channel cross-section variations lead to the appearance of a new solid flux source term which should be discretized properly. The stability region is controlled by wave celerities together with a proper reconstruction of the approximate local Riemann problem solution, enforcing positive values for the intermediate states of the conserved variables. Comparison of the numerical results for several analytical and experimental cases demonstrates the effectiveness, exact well-balancedness and accuracy of the scheme. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","2019","2024-11-21 21:06:48","2024-11-21 21:06:48","","8 – 34","","","181","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Publisher: Elsevier Ltd Type: Article","","","","Cladding (coating); Coupled method; Equations of motion; Exner equation; Finite volume method; Geometry; Jacobian matrices; Roe's scheme; Shallow water equations; Variable geometry","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Morphodynamic boundary value problems are used to simultaneously model shallow water hydrodynamics and sediment transport processes in estuarine and coastal systems. The governing equations of interest arise when the two-dimensional Saint-Venant equations are tightly coupled to the corresponding Exner equation. The tight coupling of these two processes presents numerous modeling and analytical challenges. The resulting nonlinear system is incompletely parabolic, and contains a nonconservative product. In this work, some of these analytical challenges are tackled by applying a local discontinuous Galerkin method to the morphodynamic system; the quantities of interest and their gradients are solved separately.

Despite its limitations, the Saint-Venant-Exner system is still (and for sure for some years) widely used in industrial codes to model the bedload sediment transport. In practice, its numerical resolution is mostly handled by a splitting technique that allows a weak coupling between hydraulic and morphodynamic distinct softwares but may suffer from important stability issues. In recent works, many authors proposed alternative methods based on a strong coupling that cure this problem but are not so trivial to implement in an industrial context. In this work, we then pursue 2 objectives. First, we propose a very simple scheme based on an approximate Riemann solver, respecting the strong coupling framework, and we demonstrate its stability and accuracy through a number of numerical test cases. However, second, we reinterpret our scheme as a splitting technique and we extend the purpose to propose what should be the minimal coupling that ensures the stability of the global numerical process in industrial codes, at least, when dealing with collocated finite volume method. The resulting splitting method is, up to our knowledge, the only one for which stability properties are fully demonstrated.

The physical problem is modeled through the shallow-water equations coupled with the Exner equation to describe the time evolution of the bed profile. The spatial discretization of the governing equations is carried out by a finite-volume method and a modified Roe scheme designed for non-conservative systems. As for the time advancing, starting from an explicit method, a linearized implicit scheme is generated, in which the flux Jacobian is computed through automatic differentiation. Second-order accuracy in space is then obtained through MUSCL reconstruction and in time through a backward differentiation formula associated with a defect-correction approach. The implicit time advancing is compared in terms of accuracy and computational time with the explicit approach for one-dimensional and two-dimensional sediment transport problems, characterized by different time scales for the evolution of the bed and of the water flow. It is shown that, whenever the use of large time steps is compatible with the capture of the water flow dynamics and of the bedload evolution, the implicit scheme is far more efficient than its explicit counterpart with a CPU reduction up to more than two orders of magnitude.

As a result, faithful numerical predictions are available for a wide range of flow conditions and empirical bed load discharge formulations, allowing to investigate the best option in each case study, which is mandatory in these type of environmental problems. When coupling the equations, the SWE are considered but including an extra conservation law for the sediment dynamics. In this way the computational cost may become unrealistic in situations where the application of the SWE over rigid bed can be used involving large time and space scales without giving up to the adequate level of mesh refinement.

Considering the fact that well-proven capacity formulae are based on one-dimensional (1D) experimental steady flows, the assessment of these empirical relations under unsteady 1D and 2D situations is important. In order to ensure the reliability of the numerical experimentation, the formulation has to be general enough to allow the use of different empirical laws. Moreover, the numerical scheme must handle correctly the coupling between the 2D shallow-water equations and the Exner equation under any condition. In this work, a finite-volume numerical scheme that includes these two main features will be exploited here in 1D and 2D laboratory test cases.

Two different mathematical models were compared: a fully coupled formulation of shallow water equations with erosion and deposition terms (a depth-averaged concentration flux model), and shallow water equations with a fully coupled Exner equation (a bed load flux model). Both models were discretized using the cell-centered finite volume method, and a second-order Godunov-type scheme was used to solve the equations. The numerical flux was calculated using a Harten, Lax, and van Leer approximate Riemann solver with the contact wave restored (HLLC). A novel slope source term treatment that considers the density change was introduced to the depth-averaged concentration flux model to obtain higher-order accuracy. A source term that accounts for the sediment flux was added to the bed load flux model to reflect the influence of sediment movement on the momentum of the water. In a one-dimensional test case, a sensitivity study on different model parameters was carried out. For the depth-averaged concentration flux model, Manning's coefficient and sediment porosity values showed an almost linear relationship with the bottom change, and for the bed load flux model, the sediment porosity was identified as the most sensitive parameter. The capabilities and limitations of both model concepts are demonstrated in a benchmark experimental test case dealing with dam-break flow over variable bed topography. © 2017 Hohai University","2017","2024-11-21 21:06:48","2024-11-21 21:06:48","","287 – 294","","4","10","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Publisher: Editorial Office of Water Science and Engineering Type: Article","","","","Approximate Riemann solver; Computational fluid dynamics; Dam-breaks; Dams; Equations of motion; Erosion and deposition; Finite volume method; Flux model; Manning's coefficients; Porosity; Sediment transport; Sediment transport model; Sedimentation; Sediments; Shallow water equations; Shallow waters","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We propose a fully coupled method to simulate motion of wave-current-seabed systems and associated multiphysics phenomena. The wave action equation, the shallow water equations, and the Exner equation are respectively used for wave, current, and seabed morphology, and the discretization is based on a second-order, flux-limiter, finite difference scheme previously developed for current-seabed systems. The proposed method is tested with analytical solutions, laboratory measurements, and numerical solutions obtained with other schemes. Its advantages are demonstrated in capturing interplay among wave, current, and seabed; it has the capability of first-order upwind schemes to suppress artificial oscillations as well as the accuracy of second-order schemes in resolving flow structures. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.","2013","2024-11-21 21:06:48","2024-11-21 21:06:48","","1694 – 1709","","7","18","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Publisher: Elsevier B.V.

It is already several years since the single-layered models have been used to model shallow water flows over erodible beds. Although such models present a real opportunity for shallow water flows over movable beds, this paper is the first to propose a multilayered solver for this class of flow problems. Design/methodology/approach: Multilayered beds formed with different erodible soils are considered in this study. The governing equations consist of the well-established shallow water equations for the flow, a transport equation for the suspended sediments, an Exner-type equation for the bed load and a set of empirical equations for erosion and deposition terms. For the numerical solution of the coupled system, the authors consider a non-homogeneous Riemann solver equipped with interface-tracking tools to resolve discontinuous soil properties in the multilayered bed. The solver consists of a predictor stage for the discretization of gradient terms and a corrector stage for the treatment of source terms. Findings: This paper reveals that modeling shallow water flows over multilayered sedimentary topography can be achieved by using a coupled system of partial differential equations governing sediment transport. The obtained results demonstrate that the proposed numerical model preserves the conservation property, and it provides accurate results, avoiding numerical oscillations and numerical dissipation in the approximated solutions. Originality/value: A novel implementation of sediment handling is presented where both averaged and separate values for sediment species are used to ensure speed and precision in the simulations. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","2020","2024-11-21 21:06:48","2024-11-21 21:06:48","","401 – 429","","2","37","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Publisher: Emerald Group Holdings Ltd.

The complete system of equations is made up of the energy balance law and the Exner equations. The numerical solution for this complete system is done in a segregated manner. First, the hyperbolic part of the system of balance laws is solved using a finite volume scheme. Three ways to compute the numerical flux have been considered, the Q-scheme of van Leer, the HLLCS approximate Riemann solver, and the last one takes into account the presence of non-conservative products in the model. The discretisation of the source terms is carried out according to the numerical flux chosen. In the second stage, the bed conservation equation is solved by using the approximation computed for the system of balance laws. The numerical schemes have been validated making comparisons between the obtained numerical results and the experimental data for some physical experiments. The numerical results show a good agreement with the experimental data. © 2021, Shanghai University.","2023","2024-11-21 21:06:48","2024-11-21 21:06:48","","885 – 922","","2","5","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Publisher: Springer Type: Article","","","","Balance law; Bed load; Complete system; Conservation equations; Equations of motion; Finite volume method; Finite-volume method; Numerical flux; Numerical methods; Numerical models; Numerical results; Numerical scheme; Sediment transport; Sedimentation; Suspended loads; Suspended sediments; Well- balanced schemes","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
