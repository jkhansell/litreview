There is a wide range of physical situations of environmental interest, such as flow in open channels and rivers, tsunami and flood modelling, that can be mathematically represented by first-order non-linear systems of partial differential equations, whose derivation involves an assumption of the shallow water type. Shallow water models may include more sophisticated terms when applied to cases of not pure water floods, such as mud/debris floods, produced by landslides. Mud/debris floods are unsteady flow phenomena in which the flow changes rapidly, and the properties of the moving fluid mixture include stop and go mechanisms. The present work reports on a numerical model able to solve the 2D shallow water equations even including bed load transport over erodible bed in realistic situations involving transient flow and movable flow boundaries. The novelty is that it offers accurate and stable results in realistic problems since an appropriate discretization of the governing equations is performed. Furthermore, the present work is focused on the importance of the computational cost. Usually, the main drawback is the high computational effort required for obtaining accurate numerical solutions due to the high number of cells involved in realistic cases. However, the proposed model is able to reduce computer times by orders of magnitude making 2D applications competitive and practical for operational flood prediction. Moreover our results show that high performance code development can take advantage of general purpose and inexpensive Graphical Processing Units, allowing to run almost 100 times faster than old generation codes in some cases.","2019","2024-11-15 19:42:33","2024-12-01 00:36:00","","1235–1252","","","19","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: Springer","","C:\Users\johan\Zotero\storage\J3TCMUYG\García-Navarro et al. - 2019 - The shallow water equations and their application to realistic cases.pdf","","Finite volumes; SWE-Exner; GPU; HPC; 2D; Validation Methods; Numerical Method; Unsteady shallow flows; Wetting/drying fronts; River flows","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

There is a wide range of physical situations in which these shallow-type formulations are applicable, such as open channels and rivers, tsunamis, floods, landslides or muddy slurries. Their numerical solution on the finite volume framework is governed by the dynamical properties of the flow, the uneven distribution of the bed level and also by the computational grid choice. The unified discretization of spatial flux derivatives and source terms has proven useful to ensure the properties of monotonicity, stability and conservation in the numerical solution. Surface shallow flows that occur in catchments and coasts usually require large space resolution over longer periods of time. The increasing complexity of the mathematical models, the advancements in numerical methods, as well as the increasing power of computation are making possible the physically-based simulation of these phenomena. The necessity of spatial resolution involves the use of a large number of elements, which increases the computational time when simulating realistic scenarios for a long time period. The resulting approach from the proper mathematical formulation, robust numerical resolution and efficient computational implementation of models (EST) can be very useful in the simulation of environmental surface processes with realistic temporal and spatial scales.","2022","2024-11-15 19:42:34","2024-11-24 04:24:49","","67–137","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Recommendations","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The Exner equation is used to model the morphological evolution of the bed, while a closure equation is needed to evaluate the rate of sediment transport. The system of Saint-Venant-Exner equations is solved in a fully coupled way using a finite-volume technique and a HLLC solver for the fluxes, with a novel wave-speed estimator adapted to the Exner equation. Wave speeds are usually derived by computing the eigenvalues of the full system, which is highly time-consuming when no analytical expression is available. In this paper, an eigenvalue analysis of the full system is conducted, leading to simple but still accurate wave-speed estimators. The new numerical scheme is then tested in three different situations: (1) a circular dam-break flow over movable bed, (2) an one-dimensional bed aggradation problem simulated on a 2D unstructured mesh and (3) the case of a dam-break flow in an erodible channel with a sudden enlargement, for which experimental measurements are available.

In this paper, these equations are combined with the two-dimensional shallow water equations to describe the flow field. The resulting system of equations can be solved in two ways: (i) in a coupled way, solving flow and sediment equations simultaneously at a given time-step or (ii) in an uncoupled manner by first solving the flow field and using the magnitudes obtained at each time-step to update the channel morphology (bed and surface composition). The coupled strategy is preferable when dealing with strong and quick interactions between the flow field, the bed evolution and the different particle sizes present on the bed surface. A number of numerical difficulties at from solving the fully coupled system of equations. These problems are reduced by means of a weakly-coupled strategy to numerically estimate the wave celerities containing the information of the bed and the grain sizes present on the bed. Hence, a two-dimensional numerical scheme able to simulate in a self-stable way the unsteady morphological evolution of channels formed by cohesionless grain size mixtures is presented. The coupling technique is simplified without decreasing the number of waves involved in the numerical scheme but by simplifying their definitions. The numerical results are satisfactorily tested with synthetic cases and against experimental data. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

An efficient and properly calibrated computational model represents a useful tool to provide insight into the catchment dynamics at hydrological and geomorphological levels. In addition, it allows to develop detailed risk management and conservation plans. The challenge of finding a compromise between computational time and level of accuracy and robustness has traditionally expanded the use of simplified models (2D) rather than full three-dimensional models for flood simulation. This work presents a GPU accelerated 2D shallow-water model for the simulation of flood events over non-erodible and erodible bed in real time. In particular, an explicit first-order finite volume scheme is detailed to control the numerical instabilities that are likely to appear when used in complex topography. The model is applied to reproduce real events in a reach of the Ebro River (Spain) and the Cinca River (Spain) in order to compare the simulation results with the field data in a large domain and long flood duration allowing an analysis of the performance and speed-up achieved by different GPU devices. The high values of fit between observed and simulated results as well as the computational times achieved are encouraging to propose the use of the model as forecasting system. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.","2024","2024-11-21 20:41:52","2024-12-01 00:37:45","","151-166","","","Part F2923","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Publisher: Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH","","","","SWE-Exner; GPU; 2D; CUDA","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Besides the hydrodynamic module, the new software includes a module for morphodynamics accounting for lateral bed slope and curvature effects.

This article reviews and presents a taxonomy of braided river morphodynamic models and discusses the challenges facing model development and use, illustrating these challenges with a case example. The taxonomy is contextualised by an initial discussion of the physical mechanisms of braiding. The taxonomy differentiates between reach-scale and catchment-scale models. Reach-scale models are usually physics-based, which are further divided based upon the mathematical approach used to solve equations (analytical or numerical) and their dimensionality (1D, 2D or 3D). Cellular automata models are one type of numerical model that replace at least some physical processes with expedient rules. A 2D physics-based approach encapsulates sufficient process complexity to provide behavioural predictions. Predictions from catchment-scale landscape evolution models have potential for providing boundary conditions. Future progress in physics-based modelling needs to address three challenges: (i) representation of flow and sediment transport; (ii) temporal and spatial scaling; and (iii) model calibration, sensitivity, uncertainty and validation. The key problem for addressing these is the dearth of laboratory or natural experiment datasets. To show that progress can be made by comparing reach-scale predictions to high-resolution observations, a case study of monitoring and modelling, conducted in the Rees River, New Zealand, is presented. Hydraulic predictions of cellular automata and shallow water equation (Delft3d) models are compared to observed inundation extent. The efficacy of high-resolution, multi-temporal morphological data for assessing 2D physics-based morphodynamic model predictions is also demonstrated. © 2016 The Author(s) Geography Compass © 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","2016","2024-11-21 20:41:53","2024-11-21 21:49:22","","102-127","","3","10","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Publisher: Blackwell Publishing","","C:\Users\johan\Zotero\storage\6GJCF9AK\Williams et al. - 2016 - Numerical Modelling of Braided River Morphodynamics Review and Future Challenges.pdf","","sediment transport; shallow-water equation; Review; Recommendations; numerical model; morphodynamics; computer simulation; boundary condition; braided river; catchment; cellular automaton; fluvial geomorphology; New Zealand; Otago; Rees River; South Island","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The coupled system of hydrodynamic and morphodynamic equations is solved by finite volume method using Godunov scheme. Roe's approximate Riemann solver is used to calculate the inviscid fluxes. The use of unstructured mesh makes the model applicable to complex domains. However, it is difficult to evaluate the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the Jacobian matrix in the global coordinate. The method proposed herein to deal with this difficulty is to transform the system into the local coordinate with one of the axes in the same direction as the interface outward normal vector. In the local coordinate system, the Jacobian matrix is simplified and the eigenvalues are analyzed using asymptotic method. Regular expansion breaks down when the flow is near critical. Uniformity of the expansion is achieved by changing the scales. Rotational invariance theorem is used to relate the interfacial fluxes in the global and local coordinate systems. Special treatment of the source term on unstructured grid makes the scheme stable and physically balanced (both mass and momentum).

The modelling system consists of three coupled model components: (i) the shallow-water equations for the hydrodynamical model; (ii) a transport equation for the dispersion of suspended sediments; and (iii) an Exner equation for the morphodynamics. These coupled models form a hyperbolic system of conservation laws with source terms. The proposed finite-volume method consists of a predictor stage for the discretization of gradient terms and a corrector stage for the treatment of source terms. The gradient fluxes are discretized using a modified Roe's scheme using the sign of the Jacobian matrix in the coupled system. A well-balanced discretization is used for the treatment of source terms. In this paper, we also employ an adaptive procedure in the finite-volume method by monitoring the concentration of suspended sediments in the computational domain during its transport process.

This coupling can be done if using a suitable Jacobian matrix. As a result, faithful numerical predictions are available for a wide range of flow conditions and empirical bed load discharge formulations, allowing to investigate the best option in each case study, which is mandatory in these type of environmental problems. When coupling the equations, the SWE are considered but including an extra conservation law for the sediment dynamics. In this way the computational cost may become unrealistic in situations where the application of the SWE over rigid bed can be used involving large time and space scales without giving up to the adequate level of mesh refinement. Therefore, for restoring the numerical efficiency, the coupling technique is simplified, not decreasing the number of waves involved in the Riemann problem but simplifying their definitions.

It is already several years since the single-layered models have been used to model shallow water flows over erodible beds. Although such models present a real opportunity for shallow water flows over movable beds, this paper is the first to propose a multilayered solver for this class of flow problems. Design/methodology/approach: Multilayered beds formed with different erodible soils are considered in this study. The governing equations consist of the well-established shallow water equations for the flow, a transport equation for the suspended sediments, an Exner-type equation for the bed load and a set of empirical equations for erosion and deposition terms. For the numerical solution of the coupled system, the authors consider a non-homogeneous Riemann solver equipped with interface-tracking tools to resolve discontinuous soil properties in the multilayered bed. The solver consists of a predictor stage for the discretization of gradient terms and a corrector stage for the treatment of source terms. Findings: This paper reveals that modeling shallow water flows over multilayered sedimentary topography can be achieved by using a coupled system of partial differential equations governing sediment transport. The obtained results demonstrate that the proposed numerical model preserves the conservation property, and it provides accurate results, avoiding numerical oscillations and numerical dissipation in the approximated solutions. Originality/value: A novel implementation of sediment handling is presented where both averaged and separate values for sediment species are used to ensure speed and precision in the simulations. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","2020","2024-11-21 21:06:48","2024-12-01 00:35:50","","401 – 429","","2","37","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Publisher: Emerald Group Holdings Ltd.

The proposed model modifies the local topography at runtime wherever the levee is overtopped without having to predefine the position and shape of the breach. The model is implemented in CUDA programming language, so that simulations can be run on graphics processing units, guaranteeing fast execution times even for high-resolution meshes and large domains. The validation is performed based on several experimental tests, and numerical predictions are in good agreement with the measurements. The strengths and weaknesses of the proposed approach are also discussed by comparison with a sediment transport model based on the Exner equation: While the latter gives good results only for breaches forming in levees built with noncohesive material, the proposed model can also be applied to cohesive embankments. The application to a historical flood event is also presented, showing that the model can effectively be employed for real field simulations also in the case of multiple breaches.","2019-01","2024-11-21 21:26:47","2024-12-01 00:02:17","","682-702","","1","55","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: 2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA Publisher: AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION Type: Article","","C:\Users\johan\Zotero\storage\HBXJDIIM\Dazzi et al. - 2019 - Integration of a Levee Breach Erosion Model in a GPU-Accelerated 2D Shallow Water Equations Code.pdf","","Finite volume method; Sediment transport; SWE-Exner; shallow water equations; erosion; finite volume; flood simulation; GPU; levee breach; sediment transport; shallow-water equation; 2D shallow water equations; Shallow water equations; 2D; CUDA; Numerical Method; FVM; experimental study; Equations of motion; finite volume method; Floods; Two-dimensional shallow water equations; flood; Sediment transport model; Computer graphics; computer simulation; Embankments; Erosion; Flood simulation; Graphics processing unit; hardware; historical perspective; levee; Levee breaches; Levees; Material characteristics; Physically-based erosion model; Program processors; Shear stress; software; topography","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The idea has recently emerged that the variability in the bed form geometry results from some randomness in sediment flux. In this paper, we address this issue by using the Exner equation and a population exchange model derived in an earlier paper. In this model, particle entrainment and deposition are idealized as population exchanges between the stream and the bed, which makes it possible to use birth-death Markov process theory to track the number of moving grains. The paper focuses on nascent bed forms on initially planar beds, a situation in which the coupling between the stream and bed is weak. In a steady state, the number of moving particles follows a negative binomial distribution. Although this probability distribution does not enter the family of heavy-tailed distributions, it may give rise to large and frequent fluctuations because the standard deviation can be much larger than the mean, a feature that is not accounted for with classic probability laws (e.g., Hamamori's law) used so far for describing bed load fluctuations. In the large-system limit, the master equation of the birth-death Markov process can be transformed into a Fokker-Planck equation. This transformation is used here to show that the number of moving particles can be described as an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process. An important consequence is that in the long term, the number of moving particles follows a Gaussian distribution. Laboratory experiments show that this approximation is correct when the mean number per unit length of stream, equation image/L, is sufficiently large (typically two particles per centimeter in our experiments). The particle number fluctuations give rise to bed elevation fluctuations, whose spectrum falls off like ω−2 in the high-frequency regime (with ω the angular frequency) and variance grows linearly with time. These features are in agreement with recent observations on bed form development (in particular, ripple growth).","2010","2024-11-21 21:48:33","2024-12-01 00:36:00","","","","F2","115","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: Wiley Online Library","","C:\Users\johan\Zotero\storage\MX45XET7\Ancey - 2010 - Stochastic modeling in sediment dynamics Exner equation for planar bed incipient bed load transport.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This model has proved useful, in particular through numerical simulations, for hydraulic engineering purposes (like estimating the mass of sediments that is drained through an open dam). Though, the model is also coarse. And its applicability at various space and time scales remains a question of considerable interest for sedimentologists. In particular, physical experiments from the grain scale to the laboratory scale reveal important fluctuations of the solid flux in given hydrodynamical conditions. This work is a preliminary study of the coupling of a stochastic Exner equation with a hydrody-namical model for large scales.

In his work, Exner presents a simplified bed evolution model derived from the conservation of fluid mass and an “erosion” equation that is commonly referred to as the sediment continuity or Exner equation. Given that Exner’s model takes the form of a nonlinear hyperbolic equation, one expects, depending on the given initial condition of the bed, the formation of discontinuities in the solution in finite time. The analytical solution provided by Exner for his model is the so-called classical or genuine solution of the initial-value problem, which is valid while the solution is continuous. In this paper, using the general theory of nonlinear hyperbolic equations, we consider generalized solutions of Exner’s classic bed evolution model thereby developing a simple theory for the formation and propagation of discontinuities in the bed or so-called sediment bores.","2007","2024-11-21 21:48:33","2024-12-01 00:35:51","","305–311","","3","133","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: American Society of Civil Engineers","","C:\Users\johan\Zotero\storage\NBBGGCWW\Kubatko and Westerink - 2007 - Exact discontinuous solutions of Exner’s bed evolution model Simple theory for sediment bores.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We show that, for some bedload transport models like the well-known Meyer-Peter and Müller model, the system is hyperbolic and, thus, linearly stable, only under some constraint on the velocity. In practical situations, this condition is hopefully fulfilled. Numerical approximations of such system are often based on a splitting method, solving first shallow water equation on a time step and, updating afterwards the topography. It is shown that this strategy can create spurious/unphysical oscillations which are related to the study of hyperbolicity. Using an upper bound of the largest eigenvector may improve the results although the instabilities cannot be always avoided, e.g. in supercritical regions.","2011","2024-11-21 21:48:33","2024-12-01 00:35:49","","980–989","","8","34","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: Elsevier","","C:\Users\johan\Zotero\storage\27ZC6E6I\Cordier et al. - 2011 - Bedload transport in shallow water models Why splitting (may) fail, how hyperbolicity (can) help.pdf","","Sediment transport; Exner equation; Stability; Hyperbolicity; Shallow water system; Splitting methods","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

An efficient combination of approximate Riemann solvers is proposed to compute fluxes associated with sediment-laden flow. In addition, a new method is proposed for computing the water depth and velocity values along the shear wave. This method ensures smooth solutions, even for flows with high discontinuities, and on domains with highly distorted grids. The numerical model is tested for channel aggradation on a sloping bottom, dam-break cases at flume-scale and reach-scale with flat bottom configurations and varying downstream water depths. The proposed model is tested for predicting the position of hydraulic jump, wave front propagation, and for predicting magnitude of bed erosion. The comparison between results based on the proposed scheme and analytical, experimental, and published numerical results shows good agreement. Sensitivity analysis shows that the model is computationally efficient and virtually independent of mesh refinement.","2016","2024-11-21 21:48:33","2024-12-01 00:02:06","","212","","5","8","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: MDPI","","C:\Users\johan\Zotero\storage\XHHI7B6N\Rehman and Cho - 2016 - Bed evolution under rapidly varying flows by a new method for wave speed estimation.pdf","","finite volume method; dam-break; numerical modeling; Saint Venant-Exner equations; sediment transport process","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The model is based on applying the moment approach to the Shallow Water Exner model, making it possible to recover the vertical structure of the flow. This approach allows us to obtain a better approximation of the fluid velocity close to the bottom, which is the relevant velocity for the sediment transport. A general Shallow Water Exner moment model allowing for polynomial velocity profiles of arbitrary order is obtained. A regularization ensures hyperbolicity and easy computation of the eigenvalues. The system is solved by means of an adapted IFCP scheme proposed here. The improvement of this IFCP type scheme is based on the approximation of the eigenvalue associated to the sediment transport.

The mathematical expression modeling the the hydrodynamic and morphodynamic components of the physical phenomenon are treated to deal with cross-section shape variations and empirical solid discharge estimations. The resulting coupled system of equations can be rewritten as a nonconservative hyperbolic system with three moving waves and one stationary wave to account for the source terms discretization. But, even for the simplest solid transport models as the Grass law, to find a linearized Jacobian matrix of the system can be a challenge if one considers arbitrary shape channels. Moreover, the bottom channel slope variations depends on the erosion-deposition mechanism considered to update the channel cross-section profile. In this paper a numerical finite volume scheme is proposed, based on an augmented Roe solver (first order accurate in time and space) and dealing with solid transport flux variations caused by the channel geometry changes. Channel crosssection variations lead to the appearance of a new solid flux source term which should be discretized properly. Comparison of the numerical results for several analytical and experimental cases demonstrate the effectiveness, exact wellbalanceness and accuracy of the scheme.","2018","2024-12-01 00:35:32","2024-12-01 02:50:58","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Issue: ART-2018-108658","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The fundamental aim is to understand if it is possible to capture the main features of some typical meso-scale bedforms, namely river dunes and/or antidunes, through a depth averaged approach, avoiding the numerical integration of full Navier-Stokes Equations by means of RANS or LES approach. The analysis regards the typical range of fluvial hydraulics, that is low sediment transport rate and negligible collisional effects between solid grains. The governing equations are the mass and momentum balance in the shallow water frame and the Exner equation for the bed elevation. Some classical results, considered as stated by the literature on this topic, are taken into account, namely the effects of the skin fiction and of the local bottom slope on the sediment mobility, the key parameter to evaluate the bed load transport. A source of uncertainties is the separation between the form drag effect and the skin friction effect in evaluating the total friction in a bedform-covered alluvial bottom. In order to separate such effects, we remove the average longitudinal bed slope from the momentum equation, and it is idealized as the external forcing which establishes the average mean flow in the considered domain. Firstly, a quasi-analytical approach is adopted, considering as small the sediment discharge with respect to the liquid discharge. The flux matrix eigenvalues and eigenvectors are found, and it is shown how sediment transport affects bedforms celerity and Riemann invariants. Secondly, a relaxation approach is proposed, to take properly into account the bedload time-adaptation to the local hydrodynamic conditions. In both cases, numerical computations are carried out using the Dumbser-Toro extension of the Osher Riemann Solver to non-conservative hyperbolic systems, in order to properly take into account the role of the bottom elevation as time-space variable. Some examples are shown, in typical range of existence of real river bedforms.","2014","2024-12-01 00:35:32","2024-12-01 02:51:41","","506–507","","","","","","","","","","","ECMI","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
