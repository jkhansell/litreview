The control input and measured output are both on the collocated boundary. The proportional-integral (PI) control is proposed to study both the exponential stability and the output regulation of closed-loop systems with the aid of the Lyapunov approach. An explicit quadratic Lyapunov function as a weighted function of a small perturbation of the nonuniform steady-states of different channels is constructed. We show that by a suitable choice of the boundary feedback controls, the local exponential stability and the input-to-state stability of the nonlinear Saint-Venant equations for the H<sup>2</sup> norm are guaranteed, then validated with numerical simulations. Meanwhile, the output regulation and the rejection of constant disturbances are realized as well.","2024-08","2024-11-21 21:03:51","2024-11-21 21:03:51","","4974-4987","","8","69","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Control theory; Feedback stabilization; Friction; hyperbolic systems; Irrigation; Lyapunov approach; Mathematical models; Numerical stability; Regulation; Saint-Venant equations; Steady-state","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

When these cyclones come closer to a coast, the sea level rapidly rises in the near shore region, where, the strong cyclonic winds blow towards the coast. This combined phenomenon can persist for few hours to few days which often become most destructive force as experienced in the past. This natural phenomenon known as storm surge can neither be modified nor prevented and it causes irreparable damage to life and property. The prediction of the magnitude of such cyclonic storm surges helps us to alert the disaster management personnel to articulate their activities and help the people in the coastal cities and villages to take necessary precautions. Shallow Water Equations (SWE) are the basic framework on which many real time predictions and mitigations of the aforementioned extreme hydrodynamic events could be explained and various approaches exist for solution of SWEs, mostly depending on the requirement of the problem In this paper, a hybrid Finite Volume (FV) and Finite Element (FE) based solver, which can efficiently use the depth adaptive unstructured gridding, is developed. The hybrid solver, is set up to simulate the real-time storm surge of cyclone Amphan, a Super Cyclone (SC), which made landfall over West Bengal coast, along east coast of India, on 20th May 2020. This cyclone was categorized as Very Severe Cyclonic Storm (VSCS) with wind speed close to 45 m/sand a moving wind speed of 7.5m/s approximately. Initially the model is calibrated and validated for a typical bathystrophic storm tide case and the hydrodynamic parameters like wind friction, bottom friction and eddy viscosity coefficients are attunedt The wind stress component of the calibrated numerical model is integrated with a semi-empirical cyclone model that is capable of reproducing the characteristics of cyclone Amphan. Such idealized cyclonic winds are validated with the real-time measured wind data and the final set up is used to predict the surge. The predicted surge due to cyclone Amphan, has been compared with the field measurements and the accuracy of the hybrid SWE model is evaluated.","2021-09","2024-11-21 21:03:51","2024-11-21 21:03:51","","1-8","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","ISSN: 0197-7385","","","","calibration; Extraterrestrial measurements; hydrodynamic parameters; Predictive models; Real-time systems; semi-empirical cyclone model; storm surge; Storms; super cyclone Amphan; Tropical cyclones; validation; Wind; Wind speed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The result shown computer I with processor type Intel Core i7-7500U has better speedup performance ( 3.291493 times of serial computing) than Computer II with processor type AMD Ryzen 5 2400G. Meanwhile, using computer II, the speedup of parallel computing is obtained 3.751561 times of serial computing. Indeed this discrepancy occurs because of the processor type of Computer I is higher than Computer II. Moreover, the efficiency of Computer II is 11.5% lower than computer II which is conducted 91.1367% efficiency. This means using Computer II the ability of parallel codes to achieve best performance proportional to the number of processor is obtained. Furthermore, the numerical simulation using UDCHR is shown in a good agreement with the staggered grid scheme of two-layer SWE and SWE-Exner model.","2019-07","2024-11-21 21:03:51","2024-11-21 21:03:51","","1-5","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Computational modeling; high performance computing; Mathematical model; Numerical models; Numerical simulation; OpenMP; Parallel processing; sediment movement; Sediments; simulation; Surfaces; Upwinding dispersive correction hydrostatic reconstruction","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The full hyperbolic system is written as two subsystems, namely the reduced system representing the slow dynamics and the boundary-layer system standing for the fast dynamics. By choosing the boundary conditions for the reduced system as zero, the slow dynamics is stabilized in finite time. The main result is illustrated with a design of boundary control for a linearized Saint-Venant-Exner system. The stabilization of the full system is achieved with different boundary conditions for the fast dynamics.","2014-12","2024-11-21 21:03:52","2024-11-21 21:03:52","","2840-2845","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","ISSN: 0191-2216","","","","Boundary conditions; Equations; Mathematical model; Perturbation methods; Sediments; Stability analysis; Symmetric matrices","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

For the other component the choice of the Exner law has been made using a function of the solid transport discharge, the Grass model.
