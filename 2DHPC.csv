0,The shallow water equations and their application to realistic cases,"The numerical modelling of 2D shallow flows in complex geometries involving transient flow and movable boundaries has been a challenge for researchers in recent years. There is a wide range of physical situations of environmental interest, such as flow in open channels and rivers, tsunami and flood modelling, that can be mathematically represented by first-order non-linear systems of partial differential equations, whose derivation involves an assumption of the shallow water type. Shallow water models may include more sophisticated terms when applied to cases of not pure water floods, such as mud/debris floods, produced by landslides. Mud/debris floods are unsteady flow phenomena in which the flow changes rapidly, and the properties of the moving fluid mixture include stop and go mechanisms. The present work reports on a numerical model able to solve the 2D shallow water equations even including bed load transport over erodible bed in realistic situations involving transient flow and movable flow boundaries. The novelty is that it offers accurate and stable results in realistic problems since an appropriate discretization of the governing equations is performed. Furthermore, the present work is focused on the importance of the computational cost. Usually, the main drawback is the high computational effort required for obtaining accurate numerical solutions due to the high number of cells involved in realistic cases. However, the proposed model is able to reduce computer times by orders of magnitude making 2D applications competitive and practical for operational flood prediction. Moreover our results show that high performance code development can take advantage of general purpose and inexpensive Graphical Processing Units, allowing to run almost 100 times faster than old generation codes in some cases."
3,Shallow Water Flow Simulation: From Mathematics to Reality,"Nowadays, the great power of modern computers combined with well-designed numerical models allows to develop computational models able to deal with simulations of several coupled phenomena over detailed complex topography. An efficient and properly calibrated computational model represents a useful tool to provide insight into the catchment dynamics at hydrological and geomorphological levels. In addition, it allows to develop detailed risk management and conservation plans. The challenge of finding a compromise between computational time and level of accuracy and robustness has traditionally expanded the use of simplified models (2D) rather than full three-dimensional models for flood simulation. This work presents a GPU accelerated 2D shallow-water model for the simulation of flood events over non-erodible and erodible bed in real time. In particular, an explicit first-order finite volume scheme is detailed to control the numerical instabilities that are likely to appear when used in complex topography. The model is applied to reproduce real events in a reach of the Ebro River (Spain) and the Cinca River (Spain) in order to compare the simulation results with the field data in a large domain and long flood duration allowing an analysis of the performance and speed-up achieved by different GPU devices. The high values of fit between observed and simulated results as well as the computational times achieved are encouraging to propose the use of the model as forecasting system. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024."
4,High performance computing in river modelling: A novel two-dimensional software for river hydro- And morphodynamic simulations,"The numerical modelling of river physical dynamics is of great importance for both process understanding in environmental science and decision support in engineering practice. The continuous gain in computational power and the development of novel numerical algorithms, facilitated the wide application of shallow water models for river flow simulation. Despite the technological and numerical advances, the computational effort required by two-dimensional shallow water river models can still range from days to weeks for, e.g., large-scale simulations or when morphodynamic studies are included. In this context, we developed and implemented the new version 3 of the freeware BASEMENT, a two-dimensional numerical simulation tool, adopting a flexible software framework for different target platforms such as multi-core CPUs or graphics processing units (GPUs). This allows for simulation speedup of a multiple of ten, depending on the problem at hand and the final target platform. Besides the hydrodynamic module, the new software includes a module for morphodynamics accounting for lateral bed slope and curvature effects. We demonstrate the outstanding performance of the software, its robustness and accuracy by hydro- and morphodynamic test cases. The results confirm that BASEMENT could be a useful tool to efficiently simulate complex and long-term river processes on large domains. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, London"
22,A new 2D ESPH bedload sediment transport model for rapidly varied flows over mobile beds,"A 2D Eulerian meshless bedload sediment transport model is developed using smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) to simulate rapidly varied flows over mobile beds. In the developed model, we adopt a weakly coupled numerical approach to explicitly solve the governing equations, including 2D shallow water equations for fluid flow motion and the Exner equation for bed sediment movement at the same time step. A defined virtual bedload velocity in a weakly coupled approach is involved in the calculation of time step sizes. However, nonphysical virtual bedload velocities, which often occur in cases with nearly flat beds, require extremely small time step sizes. A formulation of the lower and upper bounds of information propagation speeds for an HLLC approximate Riemann solver is thus proposed to remedy the problem. Four case studies involving dam break flows in prismatic and erodible channels, knickpoint migration, dam erosion due to overtopping flow and dam-break flow in an erodible channel with an abrupt expansion are adopted to validate the developed model. In addition, to compare the performances of different particle interaction configurations under Cartesian uniform particle arrangements, four and eight interacting particles are obtained by changing the smoothing length. Against the measured results, the case of eight interacting particles shows more accurate predictions of erosion peaks along the measured cross-sections because the lateral flows are significant. The good agreement between the simulated and measured results shows that the developed 2D Eulerian SPH bedload sediment transport model with eight interacting particles is well suited for simulating complicated flow-induced bed erosion."
126,A Block-Structured Adaptive Mesh Refinement Solver for Morphodynamic Modeling,"An adaptive solver for two-dimensional horizontal morphodynamic modeling studies is presented. The method employs an established augmented Riemann solver to compute unsteady, two-dimensional flows over arbitrary topography. An Exner equation is used to model the evolution of the bed using several common load formulas. The morphodynamic coupling is stabilized using an upwind approach. The scheme is implemented in a highly scalable block-structured adaptive mesh refinement framework. The resulting solver is well balanced and resolves the dry state while maintaining nonnegative depth. Idealized tests include comparison with exact Riemann solutions for dam break problems and an analytical solution for the migration of a one-dimensional sinusoidal bedform. Practical tests include the migration of a Gaussian perturbation and the evolution of flood and ebb shoals in a tidal inlet. The solver is benchmarked on a modern multiprocessor machine to quantify the scalability of the approach."
145,Comparison of new efficient 2D models for the simulation of bedload transport using the augmented Roe approach,"The bedload transport system of equations, composed by the two-dimensional shallow water equations for the free surface flow motion and the 2D Exner or bedload transport equation for the erodible bed layer, is used for a wide range of sediment transport processes in environmental surface flows. In this work, the numerical resolution has been implemented using improved and efficient versions of two different strategies for combining the hydrodynamical and morphodynamical components of the system. The first strategy is based on the full coupling of the flow and bedload transport equations (FCM), leading to a new formulation for the intercell numerical fluxes which includes the bed elevation into the resolution of the approximated local Riemann problem (RP) at the edges. The stability region of this method is controlled by the eigenvalues of the coupled Jacobian matrix at each intercell edge. On the second hand, an alternative decoupled strategy is considered based on solving independently the shallow water and the bed transport equations at each time step but controlling the stability region by means of an approximation of the coupled Jacobian matrix eigenvalues. This method, called approximate-coupled (ACM) allows simpler expressions for the numerical fluxes at the edges and ensures the stability of the scheme. Both strategies are based on the Finite Volume (FV) method using Roe's approach for the computation of the numerical fluxes between neighbouring cells and have been implemented into the same CPU-based numerical kernel in order to perform a realistic comparison of the range of applicability and computational efficiency. The ACM can only guarantee non-oscillatory results when the bed-flow interaction factor is small G≤O(10−3). If the interaction factor G is medium or high, G>O(10−2), the decoupled scheme loses its accuracy and robustness. Furthermore, for highly erosive flows the FCM scheme demonstrates to be more efficient in terms of computational effort than the ACM, one of the key points for large-scale and long-term bedload transport realistic applications. © 2021 The Author(s)"
147,Two-dimensional numerical modelling of shallow water flows over multilayer movable beds,"The two-dimensional modelling of shallow water flows over multi-sediment erodible beds is presented. A novel approach is developed for the treatment of multiple sediment types in morphodynamics. The governing equations include the two-dimensional shallow water equations for hydrodynamics, an Exner-type equation for morphodynamics, a two-dimensional transport equation for the suspended sediments, and a set of empirical equations for entrainment and deposition. Multilayer sedimentary beds are formed of different erodible soils with sediment properties and new exchange conditions between the bed layers are developed for the model. The coupled equations yield a hyperbolic system of balance laws with source terms. As a numerical solver for the system, we implement a fast finite volume characteristics method. The numerical fluxes are reconstructed using the method of characteristics which employs projection techniques. The proposed finite volume solver is simple to implement, satisfies the conservation property and can be used for two-dimensional sediment transport problems in non-homogeneous isotropic beds without need of complicated three-dimensional equations. To assess the performance of the proposed models, we present numerical results for a wide variety of shallow water flows over sedimentary layers. Comparisons to experimental data for dam-break problems over movable beds are also included in this study. © 2020 Elsevier Inc."
149,Well-balanced central-upwind scheme for a fully coupled shallow water system modeling flows over erodible bed,"Intense sediment transport and rapid bed evolution are frequently observed under highly-energetic flows, and bed erosion sometimes is of the same magnitude as the flow itself. Simultaneous simulation of multiple physical processes requires a fully coupled system to achieve an accurate hydraulic and morphodynamical prediction. In this paper, we develop a high-order well-balanced finite-volume method for a new fully coupled two-dimensional hyperbolic system consisting of the shallow water equations with friction terms coupled with the equations modeling the sediment transport and bed evolution.The nonequilibrium sediment transport equation is used to predict the sediment concentration variation. Since bed-load, sediment entrainment and deposition have significant effects on the bed evolution, an Exner-based equation is adopted together with the Grass bed-load formula and sediment entrainment and deposition models to calculate the morphological process. The resulting 5. ×. 5 hyperbolic system of balance laws is numerically solved using a Godunov-type central-upwind scheme on a triangular grid. A computationally expensive process of finding all of the eigenvalues of the Jacobian matrices is avoided: The upper/lower bounds on the largest/smallest local speeds of propagation are estimated using the Lagrange theorem. A special discretization of the bed-slope term is proposed to guarantee the well-balanced property of the designed scheme. The proposed fully coupled model is verified on a number of numerical experiments. © 2015 Elsevier Inc."
155,Linearized implicit time advancing and defect correction applied to sediment transport simulations,"The numerical simulation of sediment transport problems is considered in this paper. The physical problem is modeled through the shallow-water equations coupled with the Exner equation to describe the time evolution of the bed profile. The spatial discretization of the governing equations is carried out by a finite-volume method and a modified Roe scheme designed for non-conservative systems. As for the time advancing, starting from an explicit method, a linearized implicit scheme is generated, in which the flux Jacobian is computed through automatic differentiation. Second-order accuracy in space is then obtained through MUSCL reconstruction and in time through a backward differentiation formula associated with a defect-correction approach. The implicit time advancing is compared in terms of accuracy and computational time with the explicit approach for one-dimensional and two-dimensional sediment transport problems, characterized by different time scales for the evolution of the bed and of the water flow. It is shown that, whenever the use of large time steps is compatible with the capture of the water flow dynamics and of the bedload evolution, the implicit scheme is far more efficient than its explicit counterpart with a CPU reduction up to more than two orders of magnitude. This makes implicit time differencing an attractive option for complex real life applications in this area. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd."
167,Integration of a Levee Breach Erosion Model in a GPU-Accelerated 2D Shallow Water Equations Code,"This paper presents a two-dimensional shallow water equations code coupled with a physically based erosion model, able to predict the opening and evolution of breaches forming in levees built with either cohesive or noncohesive material. The bottom elevation change is evaluated using an excess shear-stress equation, which accounts for the hydrodynamic conditions and for the material characteristics. The proposed model modifies the local topography at runtime wherever the levee is overtopped without having to predefine the position and shape of the breach. The model is implemented in CUDA programming language, so that simulations can be run on graphics processing units, guaranteeing fast execution times even for high-resolution meshes and large domains. The validation is performed based on several experimental tests, and numerical predictions are in good agreement with the measurements. The strengths and weaknesses of the proposed approach are also discussed by comparison with a sediment transport model based on the Exner equation: While the latter gives good results only for breaches forming in levees built with noncohesive material, the proposed model can also be applied to cohesive embankments. The application to a historical flood event is also presented, showing that the model can effectively be employed for real field simulations also in the case of multiple breaches."
